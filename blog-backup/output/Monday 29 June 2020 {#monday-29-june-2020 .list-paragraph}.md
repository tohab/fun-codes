### [What I think about when I think about running](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/what-i-think-about-when-i-think-about.html)  {#what-i-think-about-when-i-think-about-running .list-paragraph}

Today, rather predictably, running was the thing that really centered
me. I try to run most days, but that doesn\'t happen unless I\'m coerced
into it by some third party. The feeling before a run \-- a feeling of
lethargy and attachment to a present couch \-- is one that all runners
know. I think the only difference between fast runners and slow runners
is that fast runners can get outside, every time.\
\
In engineering or computer science, people often try to find the
shortest path between two points. Pure efficiency. In running, however,
the goal is really to find the *longest* path to your destination. Pure
inefficiency. In fact, most times when I run I do go in a circle\*,
which doesn\'t get me anywhere at all! These days such an idea seems
slightly barbaric. But somehow, the act of running \-- no matter how
painful and inefficient \-- brings me a certain joy. I do love that
feeling, pressing my feet into the earth, step after step, and slowly
making my way to some place ahead. I usually have no destination in
mind, and I try to take every detour and passage-way and unexplored
street I can possibly find.\
\
Sometimes when I run I look around, seeing the branches and trees and
children and dogs playing about. It\'s quite rare on a run that I finish
and think \"wow, there was absolutely nothing of interest on the 4 miles
I jogged.\" But if I\'m honest with myself, I don\'t pay much attention
to my surroundings. I\'m usually absorbed in myself, deconstructing
something someone said to me, mulling over how I wasn\'t invited to some
exciting event, or occasionally, thinking about what to write in my
journal.\
\
Wherever I went, and whatever was on my mind, when my run is over my
mind is clear. The stormy clouds part to reveal a summer\'s day.\
\
\* or rather, a closed path. My multi-variable calculus professor,
[Maciej Zworski](https://math.berkeley.edu/~zworski/), would correct me
on that.
