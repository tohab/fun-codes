*Yeah, I\'ve become really good friends with Iggy\'s sister. But it\'s
weird.*

Why\'s it weird? Are you dating?

*No. It\'s just weird because Iggy\'s dead. *

*Iggy\'s friends are just really nice. If I died and you came and met my
friends, you\'d find out they\'re all dick heads. That\'s just the
truth. But Iggy\'s friends are good people.*

*And this guy Oscar, you played basketball with him and Iggy that one
time. I thought he was more reserved and I\'m more out-going, you know,
so we never really got on. But since Iggy passed, I don\'t know, we\'ve
been hanging out a bunch, talked till 3am one time. About Iggy and other
things. That\'s the thing, you know. You only need one thing in common
to become friends. *

*Me and his mates, we organized a football match for him. There was like
a hundred people, playing and watching. Some people met me there and
they said, \"you\'re John, aren\'t you??\" They were like so excited to
meet me because Iggy had talked about me. And they knew about my life
actually, just because of what Iggy had said. And that made me happy.*
