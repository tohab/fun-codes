### [How Rohan Plays Chess \-- A Career Framework](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/07/how-rohan-plays-chess-career-framework.html)  {#how-rohan-plays-chess----a-career-framework .list-paragraph}

Here's how I decide which moves to play in chess.

1.  Think of a handful of non-stupid moves to play

2.  Broadly look at how each move would advance my position

3.  Short-list to one or two moves I like based on:

    -   The opponent's position

    -   What I'm familiar with

    -   My gut feeling (this may be the deciding factor)

4.  Before you move, calculate a few moves ahead to make sure your
    > chosen move isn't a blunder.

    -   If it is, go back to your initial list or short-list and repeat
        > this step. 

    -   If it isn't, play the move.

There are some situations where this algorithm isn't necessary, and you
can choose a move much quicker:

-   You need to get out of a situation like check or prevent a checkmate
    > at all costs.

-   There's a major opportunity on the board that would be
    > game-changing. Taking a queen or rook, for example.

    -   Or controlling the center of the board. This has no immediate
        > material advantage, but actually provides benefits later on.

And here are some stylized facts from this framework:

-   Every chess game is different.

    -   No matter how sure you are of your strategy, your opponent's
        > moves have a huge impact on the game. So you can't feasibly
        > think 10-20 moves in advance.

    -   Advice has limited value. There may be some general principles,
        > but those are often overshadowed by the specifics of the game.
        > Advice can also be overshadowed by your style of playing chess
        > and what you feel comfortable doing.

-   The goal of the opening is to set up for a strong middle game. 

    -   Although there are some situations where you can checkmate in
        > two or four moves, those situations extremely rare.

    -   So don't get greedy. In the beginning, carefully develop your
        > pieces rather than gunning for a check-mate.

-   There is no one right opening. It depends on how you like to play.

    -   But know that your opening will, in an unpredictable way, affect
        > the rest of your game.

But what positions are worth striving for? How do you choose which
opponents to face? These questions are out of the scope of this post.
