### [Happy Birthday Stefan!](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/07/happy-birthday-stefan.html)  {#happy-birthday-stefan .list-paragraph}

*There once was a young Homentcovschi,*

*Whose legs were quite long and lanky.*

    *He sure loved the snow*

    *And skied like a pro*

*But off-season Stefan became cranky.*

*At the old age of twenty,*

*Stefan\'s joints ached aplenty*

    *So he looked hard at worms*

    *To age on [his]{.underline} terms*

*And [lysosomal
secrets](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/26/eaaz9805.full.pdf)
were found to his glee*

*Some days Stefan plays bio-engineer*

*Other times he is a fine mountaineer!*

    *A cooker of chille*

    *He\'s really quite silly,*

*He\'ll rick-roll you on trumpet for
[years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzXXHVhGXTQ)*

*On this fine day we\'ll celebrate*

*He who\'s my friend and roommate*

    *In summery July*

    *Thirty upon nigh*

*We honor this Homentcovschi\'s birth-date.*
