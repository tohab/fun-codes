### [I\'ve lost my faith in numbers](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2019/11/ive-lost-my-faith-in-numbers.html)  {#ive-lost-my-faith-in-numbers .list-paragraph}

When I was little, I used to love playing with numbers. I'd try the New
York Times Sudoku puzzles with my mom. I would hone my skills in
arithmetic in games online and then zoom through the "minute
multiplication" in school, loving the competition of it. I even learned
a trick to calculate the day of the week of any date, past, present, or
future, inspired by a TED talk I watched. Every bit of math and
numerical manipulation enthralled me.\
\
There is something intoxicating about studying mathematics. It follows
the rhyme and reason not of Shakespeare, but of propositional logic; the
only thing you need to do to "prove" something is write a few statements
that indicate it is so. Those nasty word problems involving lots of
algebra seem impossible at first, but after a moment of realization it's
clear that all that's needed to solve them is to write an equation in a
special way. The harder the problem, the more complicated the equation
-- this is a trend that follows some for years beyond high school.\
\
In a certain way it seems ridiculous. But I have always believed in
numbers. I have always trusted data, so long as there's a lot of it. And
this is a conviction that is widespread in many fields -- that the best
way to solve climate change is to "engineer" a solution, that the best
way to solve inequality is a more progressive wealth tax, that the best
way to stop disease is to model it with differential equations. Such a
belief, again, is intoxicating. It turns the big, bad, messy world into
an easy model. The unspoken assumption in economics, science,
engineering, is that there's a solution if you simply level up the
mathematics -- that with sufficiently detailed equations, you can
describe our society.\
\
It was shocking to me to realize that this is not how the world works. I
realized that despite the hundreds of millions of people trapped in
poverty -- a number so big it should shock any numerate person -- no one
really cares. I realized that despite the certainty that the world is
*dying* -- through hundreds of scientifically proven statements -- the
political forces are simply not there. And I realized that despite the
*billions* of non-human beings we murder, ruthlessly, every year... No
one wants to talk about animal rights.\
\
Why is this? Why are we as human beings so unwilling to accept facts
right in front of us? Why do we cling to what is known instead of what
the data says?\
I feel what is lacking in raw numbers is a *story*. Truly, a story.
Stories last for thousands of years -- myths and legends from ancient
India, China, Greece... anywhere have been passed down through
generations. I remember when I was little, too, I would beg my mom to
continue reading Enid Blyton's *The Five Find-outers* as she sat by my
bedside. I would be entranced by the mythological world of Percy
Jackson, and by the magic of *Eragon* and *Guardians of Ga'Hoole*.\
\
These stories, statistics, have *no basis* in reality. They probably
don't even follow the laws of physics. And yet I was, am, and will
always be transfixed by stories. And I think others are too. Barack
Obama's speech in 2004, simply telling the *story* of his family coming
to America, is known as the one that made him president. Upton
Sinclair's *The Jungle* shed light on the horrific meat-packing industry
in a way that labor statistics never could, thus bringing about massive
legislative changes in the meat-packing industry. And of course, the
story of Rosa Parks in the Civil Rights Movement -- not the countless
facts about discrimination in America -- is what sparked a wave of
resistance across the South.\
\
There's no science to story-telling. However much I may long for it, no
equation can predict which stories will cut to the hearts of people. No
computer (not yet) can write a *real* story -- one with characters you
fall in love with, one that shakes you at the core. Thus the
story-teller gains an extraordinary power. When I find time to read a
novel (recently, Khaled Hosseini's *A Thousand Splendid Suns*) I
remember the magic it takes.\
\
I've always been told numbers -- big data, statistics, economics -- are
the way to land a job and change the world. I think now that to really
make people *care*, it's really important to nourish the art of
story-telling. There's really nothing like it.

### [Coulter, Cancel Culture, and Compassion](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/05/coulter-cancel-culture-and-compassion.html)  {#coulter-cancel-culture-and-compassion .list-paragraph}

*On November 22nd, 2019 the Berkeley College Republicans hosted Ann
Coulter, a conservative commentator, on the UC campus. Several hundred
students and anti-fascist protesters demonstrated before and during the
speech. Police was called to prevent violence, and eventually 5 were
arrested in the rally.*\
\
"Ann Coulter is a fascist" were the signs posted on Dwinelle Hall. Such
a statement is widely agreed upon by most liberals -- statements like
"why do we let people in wheelchairs become citizens? I feel sorry for
cripples, but that doesn't mean I want them in my country.", or "I have
to say I'm all for public flogging.", or "God gave us the earth. We have
dominion over the plants, the animals, the trees." Such blatantly
discriminatory statements, statements marginalizing people in
already-difficult circumstances... Statements that define who is
superior, who is inferior, and who is allowed to be a citizen. Such
statements are akin to those made in Nazi Germany -- this is fascism in
the extreme.\
\
And so, the argument goes, Ann Coulter should not be allowed on our
campus. Now, this is where things get a little tricky.\
\
On the one hand, she technically *does* have the right, at least in the
US, to speak. No matter how vilely racist, one might say that she is
protected by the "right" to Free Speech. This is, however, with a
caveat: that her speech does not cause or incite violence against anyone
else. You have the right to say, "I disagree with Trump," but not to say
anything encouraging physical harm against him. And despite the
horridness of her statements, Ann Coulter doesn't directly incite
violence.\
\
On the other hand, one might extend this concept of *physical* violence
to *emotional* violence. UC Berkeley, some claim, should be a sanctuary
for marginalized groups -- a place for people to feel safe and
unthreatened. Ann Coulter's words -- even if they are just words --
threaten minorities at this university, hearkening back to threats
against Jews in the Holocausts. It is horrifyingly scary.\
\
So what's my issue? Why am I writing this post? My problem isn't one
about vision; I believe in the same world that the anti-fascist protests
were fighting for last night. I have an issue of approach -- that
*shutting down* speakers with such forcefulness is simply not in line
with the world of peace and tranquility that we are striving for.\
\
I believe that this is related to "Cancel Culture". Cancel Culture is
something we've all heard of -- the idea that in order to educate people
about social inequalities, we should simply call them out. In order to
stop racism, it is said, we have to ridicule someone every time they
call Africa a country. In order to stop speciesism, we need to vilify
anyone eating an animal. And in order to stop fascism, we have to call
fascists out when they speak and **shut them down**.\
\
Such a culture is reflected in the very framing of many movements:
"*Anti*fascists", rather than "liberationists"; the "United Week
*Against* Hate" (from Carol Christ's campus-wide email), not the "United
Week for Love"; that "Ann Coulter is not welcomed here" (from the Black
Student Union's statement).\
\
The mere framing of these issues turn them into a controversial one.
Leftist groups -- groups pushing for a compassionate, just and inclusive
society -- have fallen into the trap of using shocking, negative
language to communicate a message. This makes admirable activists be
subject to critique, because to the uninformed observer, "Ann Coulter is
not welcomed here" also seems like a type of fascism.\
\
And it's quite clear that *positive* framings are an essential part of
social movements. In the 1960s, oppressed black people fought for Civil
Rights as well as anti-segregation laws. In the 1990s, queer people
fought for Marriage Equality and against a culture of homophobia. But it
is the compassionate messaging that sticks with us -- it is abundantly
clear from their message that the Civil and Gay Rights Movements were
fighting for a just world, a prospect far more agreeable. This is simply
what I wish the Berkeley protesters would take into consideration.\
\
And with this compassionate language comes compassionate dialog between
people of different backgrounds. We should engage in evidence-based
dialog, not shut down opposition after one bigoted statement. We should
do creative, positive demonstrations in line with the just world that we
imagine. We should channel the energies used against fascists and use it
*for* a more beautiful world. *That*, to me, is what social justice is
about.
