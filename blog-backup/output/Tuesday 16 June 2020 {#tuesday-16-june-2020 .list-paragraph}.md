### [Yeasty Love](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/yeasty-love.html)  {#yeasty-love .list-paragraph}

Shall I compare thee\
To a mush-a-room?\
Whose earthy presence\
Roasts deliciously.\
\
Rich in vitamin\
And in heart\
Your strength to grow\
When we\'re apart.\
\
You grew on me,\
And the tomatoes in the fridge,\
Slow at first but suddenly\
My fridge was full of you.\
\
At times you have me truffled\
With a magic sort of trance\
I turn to spirituality\
As you make me want to dance.\
\
Deep in earth you may bring light\
[To

you bring sensation\
To me you bring scrumptiousness\
In one bulbous creation.
