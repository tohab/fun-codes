### [Wealth-based affirmative action?](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/07/wealth-based-affirmative-action.html)  {#wealth-based-affirmative-action .list-paragraph}

I can understand why many lefties are in a huff about affirmative
action. Affirmative action policies are meant to be anti-racist, and
maybe reverse residual effects of racist American policies of the past
and general prejudice of society at large. Plus, universities like
having multicolored recruitment posters. 

However even with affirmative action, elite universities have a horrid
track record of admitting marginalized students. Here\'s data from my
old economics professor Danny Yagan and others about how elite
universities by-and-large take in students with very high-income
families and spit them out into the high-income labor market. Stories of
a low-class student of color\'s life being changed through education are
statistically, few and far between. 

Family wealth and income, to me, is what really matters in terms of
education and inequality. Race is tied to it, but not the only thing
that divides the have and the have-nots. So although Clarence Thomas and
his posy in the Supreme Court have struck down race-based affirmative
action, aren\'t there other still-legal policies that can amend American
inequality? I\'m curious if so, and if not, why not.
