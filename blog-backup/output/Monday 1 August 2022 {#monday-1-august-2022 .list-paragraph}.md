### [2022-08 Semiannual Update](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/2022-07-semiannual-update.html)  {#semiannual-update-3 .list-paragraph}

Hello there!

I\'ve realized that as life goes on and I meet more people and live in
more places, it becomes challenging to keep in touch with everyone on
how our lives are going.

So here\'s my solution: an email list! I plan on sending it out just
twice a year (around January & July). This way, I can share about my
life and elaborate more than I could in an Instagram post description.

This list also makes me remember to keep in touch with family and
friends, past and present. If you are reading this and it\'s been a
while since we\'ve talked, drop me a line, long or short! I hope we can
catch up soon.

So onto the updates! In this post: Graduation, Music & Arts, Research,
and Taiwan.

Warmly,

Rohan

**Graduation**

It\'s hard to believe but in May I did graduate from UC Berkeley! I
thouroughly enjoyed my time there, and I was especially grateful for
this last year being in-person.

Graduation was quite the riot. The stadium was unbearably hot, and the
audio quality sucked. So all the famous people on-stage spoke to a
fidgetty and distracted crowd of students on the field of Memorial
Stadium. I had a great time nonetheless \-- it was like a 6,000 person
mixer! After graduation, I spent a week with my parents in Yosemite
National Park. 

And then I stayed in Berkeley for a few weeks packing up and saying
goodbye to friends. I will miss my friends, the joy of being a student,
the charms of the city and Berkeleyans.

**Music & Arts**

This last semester was an extremely fruitful time for me. Since I had
finished most requirements for the economics degree, I was fortunate
enough to take two performing arts classes. One was theater, where we
did various scenes and monologs and even musical theater throughout the
semester. I had a wonderful, energetic teacher and most other students
in the class were sweet young freshmen, so it was a wholesome time. A
recording of me doing a Forrest Gump monolog is
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvw-8N6sMrI&ab_channel=rohantohab)
on Youtube.

I also took a class in jazz improvisation and reconnected with my study
of the saxophone. I had another [incredible
teacher](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/04/office-hours-with-ben-goldberg.html).
We focused partly on music theory and partly on free jazz and playing
*like you mean it*. That last part really struck a chord in me\...
Before, I was used to reading the notes on a page and playing them as
accurately as possible. But now, I\'ve realized that there\'s infinite
ways to play any song, and so many ideas that can only be expressed
through music (or sound). Some ideas are ugly, some are beautiful, but
that\'s all part of art. I\'d like to share recordings etc. of me
playing music at some point, when I decide how!

As an aside, one small thing I learned recently was how to use music
notation software. So here\'s song I wrote about Tamiami Boulevard.
It\'s a main drag near my parents\' new home in Florida.

**Research**

I wrote an academic paper that\'s coming out in October! It\'s a review
paper on the [\"Economics of the Wildlife Trade and
Consumption\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-resource-111920-010503).
I\'ve been working on this paper part-time since the summer of 2020 and
pleased to say it\'s in its final version.

We didn\'t directly do empirical research but summarized the significant
discoveries thus far and reframed it for economists. I\'m grateful to
Gordon Rausser and David Zilberman, my co-authors. They are
well-established agricultural economists and guided me through the
process.

I\'m proud of the work. I now feel more knowledgable about the wildlife
trade than I ever thought I would be. The wildlife trade has numerous
causes (as you might read in the abstract) and results in threats to
endangered species, serious animal exploitation, and increased risks of
creating pandemics like COVID-19. I was happy to work on a project I
felt was important and neglected by economists and social scientists
generally.

Nonetheless, throughout the process I realized that academia is slow,
solitary work. As much as I enjoyed the topic, there were times were I
got de-motivated working at my computer so much, especially without any
peers to talk through ideas with. So I take it as a lesson for what kind
of work I want to do in the future.

**Taiwan**

I just moved to Taiwan! I\'m teaching at an English \"cram school\"
(after-school, supplementary education) called Schoolhouse Language
Center in [Kaohsiung City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaohsiung)
(pronounced: GAO-shiong). My friend from Berkeley, Leon, is also with me
teaching at the same school.

![](vertopal_79faa9fe8c3540e3909e54d23365b6dd/media/image17.jpeg){width="1.4236111111111112in"
height="1.0694444444444444in"}

A lot people are thrown off to hear this update. People also sometimes
confuse Taiwan with Thailand, Vietnam, or China. It\'s understandable.
But Taiwan is a unique and remarkable island! Mandarin, English and
Taiwanese are the main languages here. It\'s an incredibly safe and
well-run democratic place. Public transport in the cities is extremely
efficient, and there\'s a high-speed rail that runs from Taipei to
Kaohsiung.

There\'s also a rich culture of vegetarian food because of Taiwan\'s
history of Buddhism. In general, I think there\'s a lot to learn and
experience, and this kind of move wouldn\'t be as easy when I\'m later
in my career.

A large part of my motivation for living in Taiwan is to immerse myself
in Mandarin. I studied Mandarin in middle/high school, but never got to
a decent level of fluency, and I\'ve never spent a substantial time in a
Mandarin-speaking country. I enjoy speaking, reading and writing Chinese
and think that it will be a useful language to know as China becomes a
more central global power.

Studying so far, it has been humbling. There\'s so much knowledge of
English vocabulary, grammar, and literature that I\'ve accumulated over
the years, and it\'s over-whelming to rebuild all that in Chinese. But
I\'m grateful to my Taiwanese/Chinese-American friends who have been
helping me speak with them. I wrote a couple stories in Chinese which
[you can read

(shout-out to my editor!). I also may start a Instagram (ugh, I know) or
something recording my experience here\... but we\'ll see.

**Be well, joyful and healthy these next few months!**

### [Diary Practice](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/diary-practice.html)  {#diary-practice .list-paragraph}

**七月五號**

今天我终于决定我必须要去外面跑步。在佛羅里達外面很热，所以直到今天以前，我一直打算去跑步但是我总是没出去。\
    我晚上八点出去。当时，太陽還沒下山
(我媽不讓我晚上出門,因為她擔心我遇到蛇)。我跑地（得）有一點慢,因為我幾天沒運動了.
但是,我跑步途中, 開始下一點雨.我想一想, 這樣下雨不錯! 但是,
在佛羅里達一下雨上了, 就下得很厲害. 今天也不例外. 突然,
我的衣服看起來像我剛才去游泳! 哇塞.\
    下雨的時候去外面跑步有一些好處. 比方說, 我回家以後, 我不需要洗澡!
哈哈我開玩笑. 真的好處是: 第一, 天氣比較涼快, 所以我跑得比較快!
第二個好處是水坑讓我赤腳跑步比較舒服. 而且, 我回家時看到一隻青蛙!\
    我跑步快結束的時候, 我看到雷電!. 我感到擔心.
我媽已經對蛇涉很感到可怕害怕/擔心, 她他對雷會怎麼想? 因此我趕緊
很快回家敲門. 我爸爸已經準備了一條毛巾歡迎我回家. 我叫我媽,
\"媽媽別著急!我安全得到家了!\" 但是她沒聽到我, 因為她在外面,
高興地欣賞著雨!

Today I finally decided that I have to go outside for a run. It\'s hot
outside in Florida, so until today I\'ve been going for a run but I
never get out.

I go out at eight o\'clock at night. At that time, the sun had not yet
set (my mother would not let me go out at night because she was worried
that I would encounter snakes). I\'m running a little slow because I
haven\'t exercised for a few days. However, during my run, it started to
rain a little. I think about it, it\'s raining good! Great. Today was no
exception. Suddenly, my clothes looked like I just went swimming! Wow.

Going outside for a run when it\'s raining has some benefits. For
example, when I get home, I don\'t need to take a shower! Haha I\'m
joking. The real benefits are: First, it\'s cooler, so I run faster!
Second The good thing is that the puddles make it more comfortable for
me to run barefoot. Also, I saw a frog when I got home!

Towards the end of my run, I saw thunder and lightning!. I was worried.
My mom was already terrified/worried about the snake, what would she
think of thunder? So I hurried home and knocked on the door. My dad A
towel had been prepared to welcome me home. I called my mom, \"Don\'t
worry mom! I got home safely!\" But she didn\'t hear me because she was
outside, happily admiring the rain!

 

**七月十三號**\
今天我想談談我跟乒乓球的關係. 聽說, 在大陸和台灣乒乓球是很熱門的運動.
(中國人每次都贏乒乓奧運冠軍!)\
    我在倫敦時, 我父母買一個玩意兒, 他可以從餐桌變型成乒乓求桌! 很棒,
很方便, 所以我當時很經常打乒乓球. 本來, 我每天想跟我父母打乒乓球. 但是,
我的乒乓球進步很多, 所以我們一玩我每次都贏.
我很感謝我父母讓我有這樣的乒乓球的起源故事. (其實,
因為真的乒乓球桌比較大一點, 到今天, 用真的桌子我有一點不習慣).\
    有一天, 我請了我們的鄰居的男孩子來我家. 他叫約翰, 比我大一歲.
從那天起, 我們開很好朋友. 但是更重要的是: 他的乒乓球很厲害. 各個周末,
我們每天會花至少兩小時打乒乓球. 在他學校, 約翰也打乒乓球,
但是他的同學們打得還可以. 所以我們兩個是互相最強大的對手.\
    我們就像陰和陽. 他是左撇子, 我是右撇子. 他用旋轉球, 我用扣殺.
他的乒乓球拍很凹凸不平, 我的很光滑. 就這樣, 我們從七歲到十六歲切磋
(十六歲之後, 我們兩個都很忙, 就沒有很多時間玩乒乓球).
每次我們的比賽都差不多平分了. 這樣讓我們每次繼續 \-- 下一次,
誰會呢？誰要贏了?\
    現在, 約翰住在英國, 我住在美國. 他還是我遇過最強大的乒乓球對手.
現在, 我只有一個夢想. 我希望我在台灣可以練習我的乒乓球.
之後我和約翰相遇, 我會贏的!

**July 13th (translated via Google Translate)**

Today I want to talk about my relationship with table tennis. I heard
that table tennis is a very popular sport in mainland China and Taiwan.
(Chinese people win the table tennis Olympic championship every time!).

When I was in London, my parents bought something that could transform
from a dining table to a ping pong table! It was great and convenient,
so I played ping pong a lot at the time. Originally, I wanted to play
ping pong with my parents every day. But , My table tennis has improved
a lot, so I win every time we play. I am very grateful to my parents for
letting me have such a table tennis origin story. (Actually, because the
real table tennis table is a bit bigger, to this day, I\'m not used to
using a real table).

One day, I invited our neighbor\'s boy to my house. His name is John,
and he is a year older than me. We have been good friends since that
day. But more importantly: his table tennis is great. Every weekend , we
will spend at least two hours a day playing table tennis. In his school,
John also plays table tennis, but his classmates can play well. So the
two of us are each other\'s strongest opponents.

We are like yin and yang. He\'s left-handed, I\'m right-handed. He spins
the ball, I smash. His ping pong bat is bumpy, mine is smooth. Years of
learning from each other (after the age of sixteen, both of us are so
busy that we don\'t have a lot of time to play table tennis). Every time
our game is almost evenly divided. So let\'s continue each time \-- next
time, who will win? Who is going to win?

Now, John lives in the UK and I live in the US. He is also the strongest
ping pong opponent I have ever met. Now, I only have one dream. I hope I
can practice my ping pong in Taiwan. After I met John, I will win!
