 Normally I really hate sitting down for long periods of time. Sitting
is important for lots of things like preparing for tests, having coffee
with people, sending emails, journalling, etc. I enjoy those things and
can tolerate sitting for a little bit like that. But when I think about
the monumentous task of doing something for many hours at end, day after
day at a desk it\'s rather daunting. Sitting at end also has bad health
effects on metabolism and such. It\'s said (by me) that sitting might
even be the new smoking.

The exception to my dislike of sitting is when I\'m reading a book I
really like. I\'ve recently been reading the Mistborn trilogy; a fantasy
series about a magical feudal kingdom. There\'s something about the
escapism of fantasy that lets me forget everything else going and become
obsessed with learning about the plot of the story. So maybe I can sit
after all, I just need something enrapturing enough to do.
