### [Welcome home, sir](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/05/welcome-home-sir.html)  {#welcome-home-sir .list-paragraph}

Whenever I went to the US growing up, the border control officer would
take my passport, look at my pre-pubescent face, and solemnly say,
\"welcome home, sir.\" I\'d struggle to hold back a smirk.

Home? The US was the place I was born, but the UK was the place where I
grew up. I had no memory of the US, a land foreign to me. Big roads, big
brands, big people. Cars on the wrong side of the road. Entrance to the
country was followed by a painful hour at a car rental place. That was
America \-- a place for summer trips and family friends I didn\'t know.
A vestige of my family\'s life before I knew how to speak.

Yet my documents recognized my place of birth \-- Livingstone, New
Jersey \-- and so I was welcomed home. They call border control \"the
first line of defense\". They play a video narrated by the American
president: George W. Bush, then Barack Obama, then Donald Trump when I
moved for college. In London, I observed America from a distance \--
through British news coverage, long-distance phone calls and five to
eight hours of time difference. The country I was born in was changing
all without me.

This July may be the first time I really feel what it\'s like to \"go
back to the states.\" My identity of Americanness has developed,
calloused as I\'ve lived here. When people have asked me where I\'m
from, I defer to where I lived last, which was Berkeley, California. In
Chinese, the \"beautiful country\". The process of saying this again and
again makes me think, \"hey, maybe I am American.\" Being American \--
and of an Indian-background \-- is what uniquely identifies me in
Taiwan. It\'s what makes me an English-speaker, and lets me have my job.

The young, pre-pubescent Rohan might wonder why I enjoy a visit
\"home\". To me now, I reluctantly accept that with my cultural
backgronud, America is the place to go back to. I suppose I\'ll be

### [Willy Nilly Blogging](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/05/willy-nilly-blogging.html)  {#willy-nilly-blogging .list-paragraph}

I was talking to my friend Andrew today and he said he likes my habit of
\"willy nilly\" blogging. That is, not thinking too hard about something
before publishing and sharing it with the world.

[This blog](https://marginalrevolution.com/) is a good example of this.
Tyler Cowen literally blogs twice a day. A prolific thought producer, or
at least excellent at writing thoughts down (and when thoughts are
written down, they turn into ideas).

I support this but in actuality my blogging is not that willy nilly;
I\'ve only blogged every month or two the past year.

But I just had a spark of inspiration \-- what if I could blog from my
phone? Then I could blog from the Kaohsiung MRT, a Donutes coffee shop,
or Jade Mountain. I\'m not surprised to find that there\'s an app for
that. So that\'s how I\'m blogging now.
