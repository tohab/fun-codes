      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>2024-01 Semiannual Update</title><content type='html'>Well, a lot of things are going to be changing in the next few months for me. Notably, I'm intending to leave Taiwan on May 19th. The reason for departure is nothing dramatic or decisive. It's simply that two years seemed about right. Two years is the same length as the Peace Corps, Mormon missionary service, and, for a long time, the Taiwanese military service. Two years is a substantial amount of time to live in a place, but it’s gone by remarkably fast. &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Both Berkeley and Kaohsiung have become adopted homes for me. Home in
the sense that I've gained a fondness for the people, for the
geography (within the city and without), for the way people talk and
what they talk about. I've become accustomed to the weather in
Kaohsiung, so much so that now, it is 11 degrees Celsius (52 F) and I
feel like I'm freezing my butt off. How bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;In college, however, I more or less had a set end-date. Four years. Too much longer and you get kicked out. I stuck to the standard
time-frame and then, upon graduation, moved across the Pacific.
Although leaving college was inevitable, leaving the US was not. But
moving overseas was my way of escaping adulthood in America. I
thought it too intimidating to not have all my friends living a
bike-ride away from me. I found the idea of a 9-5pm horrifyingly
confining. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Being in Taiwan for this amonut of time has let me cherish and
cultivate my non-work life. Here I've had the leisure to play ping pong, strum the
guitar, run and bike, read and listen to podcasts, play dungeons and
dragons (a new, dorky but good past-time!), and catch up on Pixar
movies, to me, is an investment in life-long happiness. Cultivating
activities that bring me calm is critical for when the going gets rough. And teaching English, honestly, has been
everything I hoped. I love the dynamism and excitement of teaching
kids. It’s a job with few stresses, mostly just joyful moments. Part of me
even worries if I’ll ever find work I love as much as this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;But I’m hoping to move back after the summer and look for what
scared me away in the first place: a “normal” job. A life that
involves an office, early morning wake-ups, preparing my own meals
again. When I graduated college, settling into that sort of life felt
like the beginning of the end. Entering the work-force was, in my
caricaturing point of view, the start of a long, tiring slog towards
retirement (and then death). I've changed my perspective. Now I believe I have the skills to make life more meaningful, even if it's built around a more routine job. For instance, how to make friends in a new city, how to explore activities I want to
do – the things you’re meant to learn in your twenties. So I’m
hoping that when I move back to the US, life is a little more
flexible and lively than I had originally thought. A “normal” job
can be rewarding, grounding even. And it’s true, after all, that
stellar pieces of music, the greatest books, the blaze-trailing
politicians and business-people mostly get their work done at a
normal office. I believe I can work like that too. Staying in
Kaohsiung too long, I'd worry won't be living up to my potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;After leaving in May I'm going to do some traveling. I'll write
another time about where and how it goes. The primary goal is
actually not to see new places. Obviously that is part of travel, and
I look forward to that. But in truth, traveling is an exercise in
becoming more of a &lt;i&gt;searcher&lt;/i&gt; rather than a &lt;i&gt;planner&lt;/i&gt;. A
&lt;i&gt;planner&lt;/i&gt; is what I am, as much as I loathe to say so. I
schedule things in advance, iron out the details, and feel a grating
discomfort when the plans change. Creating plans is like a religion
to me. It applies in all aspects of my life: what I do in my future,
what I'm doing in a week, how I bike to work. Often, even how I write
a blogpost (you might be able to tell that this blog post is more
train of consciousness). In most cases, planning in good – it helps
me feel more organized, more in control of a situation and more
relaxed. The problem, though, is that because this is so deeply
ingrained in my psyche, when something doesn't go according to plan,
it’s deeply distressing. I’m thrown in a loop and fumble around.
That is, until I concoct a new plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;I was talking to my friend Truman recently. Ten years ago, he
hitch-hiked from Europe through Russia and China and back to Taiwan.
The journey and voyages took eighteen months, and he had a total of only $8,000 to spend. Many nights he pitched a tent by a
road-side or relied on the charity of a stranger. In reflecting on
this journey, he said that when you're traveling on a shoe-string
budget, there's simply no use in worrying about the unknowns. Even
when it comes to important things – which trucker picks you up,
what you eat next meal, when you’ll next sleep on a bed – what life will look like can’t be known in advance. Worrying about the future is
useless. All you can do is pick a direction, and focus on the next
choice at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;I'm trying to channel that ethos (not necessarily Truman's
particular methods) in travel and the subsequent job search. It involves some beliefs.
Belief that things will work out. Belief that I will be okay if it
doesn't. Belief in the people I don't yet know who might help me
along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;-------- 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happy New Year, Western and Chinese.&lt;/b&gt; This year is the year
of the dragon which means I was born two Zodiac cycles ago. One's
fortune is actually inauspicious on this year and so according to
tradition in Taiwan, you're meant to do some extra prayer and stuff
to appease those folks up above. I hope I get around to it! Oh, and
it's also my golden birthday (meaning the date in April, 24, matches
my age, 24). How curious! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This time my update reads more like a journal entry. I hope you
enjoy a slightly different form and seeing my style of thinking. As
always, &lt;b&gt;I love to hear everyone's updates in return&lt;/b&gt;, even if
(especially if!) it's been a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have a question for the lovely people who read this blog.&lt;/b&gt;
I was thinking about adulting -- something I've been trying to do for
the past few years. Well, it's a work in progress, so I want to ask
you for your thoughts. How do you know when you're an adult? Have
there been any critical junctures in your life where you thought --
"wow, I'm really adulting", or conversely, "wow,
adulting is so much harder than I thought"? If you have some of
those stories please share them with me and perhaps I can include it
in the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Rohan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;PS. The jazz album &lt;span style="font-family: NSimSun;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;span lang="zh-CN"&gt;&lt;i&gt;補習&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;BAND&lt;/i&gt;
from last May is out. Music &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLmNtQG2epzFG2PwtDTz4U9OVDCsiJGG8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and post-mortem &lt;a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/11/band-album-is-out.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;PPS. A website redesign is in the works. You’ll know it when you
see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;PPS.
Some people notice grammar mistakes in the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;se&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;updates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;.
A+ for participation!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In public schools here, they don't celebrate any of those (the Chinese holidays are more sensibly spread out throughout the year). The consequence is that cram schools, and foreigners like me, end up being the representatives. It makes me delighted not to hear "Jingle Bells" in the PXMart and wonder how my students will do it when they're caroling. Hats off to my colleague, Teacher Phil, for directing a stellar matinee performance of &lt;i&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/i&gt; with his class of 2nd graders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raj Chetty comes to mind.&lt;/b&gt; His &lt;a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2010/10/kindergarten-matters" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, published a couple years ago, is famous for &lt;a href="https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-opposite-of/undermine.html"&gt;overmining&lt;/a&gt; the importance of kindergarten teachers. According to his data, an experienced kindergarten teacher in the US makes their students' adult salaries raise by $1,000 per kid. What do you learn in kindergarten? Nothing concrete -- things more like life skills, problem solving, and emotional regulation. Gives a little bit more meaning to what I'm doing as I'm shouting new English words at my youngest students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A neat look at the &lt;a href="https://newsdejavu.github.io/"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/b&gt;Powered by an LLM, of course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No place like Kaohsiung.&lt;/b&gt; I went to Taipei to show my brother around Taiwan. We arrived in Kaohsiung and I felt at home right away. There's no place like it. The vastness of Taipei is exhausting to navigate, and so is the density/intensity of the people. My brother didn't like the crowdedness, and in hindsight, I don't either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A whacky website for ping pong rackets. &lt;/b&gt;This store in Taipei had the best deals on ping pong rackets. I went there in person and got my racket and rubbers for half the price I believe I'd get anywhere else. I asked and the store guy said the prices are the same online, but Jesus, I mean look at &lt;a href="http://www.tabletennis.com.tw/index_1.htm"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;! No wonder their ping pong deals are a well-coveted secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linux vs. Windows and conformity. &lt;/b&gt;If it was up to me the world standard operating system for budget would be Linux, not Windows. Why? It's faster, doesn't have bloatware/spyware, and more easily customizable for your purposes. There's also political reasons -- it's open-source and not controlled by the monopoly that is Microsoft. But I'm sadly typing on this on Windows. Why? Well, I worked one summer for a company remotely, and they sent me a Windows laptop. As an intern, I'm not about to wipe the OS and put Linux on it, so I acclimatized, even though I didn't like it. But it got hard to switch back and forth between my personal Linux computer and the work Windows computer. So when I got a new personal computer, I didn't bother putting Linux on it, even though it would be superior. That said, neither option is bad -- I've gotten used to the Windows shortcuts, and most of what I do on my computer is through a web browser, anyways. That said, the power of inertia is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/how-to-believe-in-yourself/" target="_blank"&gt;How to Believe in Yourself&lt;/a&gt; on Hidden Brain. &lt;/b&gt;I listened to this podcast about how people can achieve their aspirations even if they were stuck at some point in life. The secret? Sometimes, going forward means taking a step back and finding a slightly different direction. This metaphor reminds me of watching Olympic rock climbing, a fascinating example of seeing how people problem solve under pressure. The other thing mentioned in the podcast is that sometimes, doing irrelevant, leisure activities can let ideas germinate in the back of your mind; or, you might even build your confidence playing something like &lt;i&gt;Words with Friends&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/i&gt; that you feel newly motivated to confront other challenges ahead of you. In conclusion, check out the podcast -- I wouldn't write about it if it wasn't worth the listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A neat look at the &lt;a href="https://newsdejavu.github.io/"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/b&gt;Powered by an LLM, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/2014482982013230956/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/12/tginc-and-other-assorted-thoughts.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/2014482982013230956'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/2014482982013230956'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/12/tginc-and-other-assorted-thoughts.html' title='TGINC and other assorted thoughts'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-4561827778394837486</id><published>2023-12-18T04:26:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-18T04:26:43.674-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>mango, beards, </title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;mango juice in the winter is a crazy, fantastic feat. of human engineering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;why do substacks always have a subject? the blog of rohan prasad is a blog about nothing in particular, and everything i want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sometimes i think of blog ideas on the go. in the future, will i be able to write a blogpost just by thinking it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you go to a restaurant, do you choose a new thing or stick with what you've got?

A fellow ping pong player at my club says it's the best place to get high quality rubber and paddles in all of Taiwan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying a ping pong paddle can get pricey if you're going for something nice. The wood itself may be 100$, but the rubber can be just as much (on each side!), and needs to be changed every few months. But then, many hobbies can get just expensive. Buying video games, musical instruments, nice paints for drawings, you name it. If you like something then you can find a way to spend money on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ping pong is something I'm never going to make money doing. But for me it's an abiding interest. I've liked it since when I was little, and enjoy playing basically whenever I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you know if a hobby is like that? I once bought a jump rope, thinking it'd an uber-efficient form of aerobic exercise, and you don't even need to leave the house. But on the other hand, running is an abiding interest I barely spend any money on. Maybe new shoes every year. But it's done wonders for my mental and physical health. Somewhere in between is my expensive saxophone. I've had it for nine years, but have only regularly practiced for about half that time. Still, music is an abiding interest of mine (on this note, I just heard &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2uKoll2LJ2jvlH1uCyuzEo"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; excellent saxophone quartet rendition of &lt;i&gt;Nimrod &lt;/i&gt;by Elgar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Discipline&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm climbing Monkey Mountain here in Kaohsiung with my friend Tim and his 7-year-old daughter Mia (names modified to preserve anonymity). Mia's happy for the first fifteen minutes; she's thrilled to be climbing up again, and excited for the tea station at the top. Then she wants a break, so we take one, and head in a direction that looks good. Turns out the way we chose isn't the one where you can find tea. Mia's furious. "I hate you, Daddy!" she cries. Tim's disappointed too, to be fair. Who doesn't want tea? He tells her, "you weren't going to drink the tea anyways." Mia's mood is like a yo-yo. Tim chocks it up to low blood-sugar. As we're climbing down, Tim promises Mia an ice-lolly at the bottom of the mountain if we get there without her complaining. She perks up at the thought, and is happy on the way down. "Daddy, I can't decide which ice-lolly to get" she says. Tim says, "that's what life's about, honey -- making decisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, a girl Yo-yo was going to join my beginning English class. She's 6 years old, like her to-be classmates, and just entered first grade. But she cried incessantly at the thought of leaving her mother. Her mother bought popcorn for the entire class, hoping that Yo-yo would get a warm welcome when she eventually came upstairs. But none of the begging or bribing was a match for Yo-yo's insistence not to go learn English. Her mother said she would come back next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teachers at my school said that Yo-yo is actually a real princess. She gets whatever she wants and when she doesn't, she cries until she does. One solution to Yo-yo isn't more bribing. By giving more rewards, you'll only encounter the hedonic treadmill, and have to heighten the stakes later on. But more discipline can make it clear that crying as a tactic doesn't work. Discipline -- ie. reprimanding when your kid isn't doing the right thing -- makes the default much easier to attain. It's tugs at the heart-strings when kids whine or are upset, but as a parent, sometimes you gotta do what you don't want to do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or that's at least what the disciplinarians say. And I wouldn't have thought it before I started teaching, but now I'm inclined to agree. When you're an adult, discipline is an ethic you build inside yourself. Will kids who were bribed with sugary snacks have more addictive personalities when they're older? Will they have less tenacity when they're confronted with a problem? Probably. Taiwanese parents are notoriously strict, but Taiwanese people are incredibly disciplined. It shows in the quality of service here. But on the other hand, kids who are disciplined too much may develop perfectionism, chronic anxiety, or imposter syndrome. Or who knows, I'm really just spit-balling here. All I can say for certain is I'm sure glad I'm not a parent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;加油&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm learning guitar on my own, and a string broke. I got the guitar used, so maybe it's about time to change the strings anyways. I got a pack of strings and started with the one that was broken. Then, all of a sudden as I'm installing the new one for that size, it breaks too! Sigh. Learning things on your has it's drawbacks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/5217291029791162313/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/11/abiding-interests-and-discipline.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5217291029791162313'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5217291029791162313'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/11/abiding-interests-and-discipline.html' title='abiding interests and discipline'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-3901196335287877643</id><published>2023-11-13T09:13:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-13T09:21:05.721-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>補習BAND the album is out</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My first album, 補習BAND, is now released! Here's the link:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLmNtQG2epzFG2PwtDTz4U9OVDCsiJGG8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLmNtQG2epzFG2PwtDTz4U9OVDCsiJGG8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am honored to play with my band-mates. Noé and Etienne both are 
conservatory graduates, and Leon's been playing piano since he before could talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, we had no idea we wanted to record an album. We just wanted to play jazz. We met up weekly and just threw out standards we had played and liked. Like our music, the idea for recording was made up spontaneously. Noé and Leon were leaving Taiwan soon, so we wanted a record of the music we made together. We tightened up our arrangements, honed our improvisations, and recorded on June 4th, 2023.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This album isn't perfect but it's something. For me, it serves as a record of where I am in my journey as a musician. Some parts are nice, and some parts make me groan. I know it'll be a piece of art I look back on in many years and think: wow, I've come a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q&amp;amp;A: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How should you listen to this music?&lt;/b&gt; I recommend listening while you're washing dishes, doing Sudoku or going for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I pronounce 補習BAND? And what does that mean? &lt;/b&gt;It's 
pronounced "boo" "she" "band". Like "booo" as in Halloween, "she" as 
in the female pronoun, and "band" meaning music group. At some point, we four ensemble 
members were all working at cram schools. The Chinese for that is 補習班 
("boo" "she" "ban"). So the album title is a bilingual homonym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why is each song so long? &lt;/b&gt;Jazz music is jam-packed with musical content. The "head" of a song is played at the beginning, but that may take just half a minute. The bulk of the time is spent on solos. Each soloist uses the head as a basis for an improvisation however long they want. This makes jazz especially hard to get right on a recording. Then, the head is played again and the song concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why isn't it on Spotify?&lt;/b&gt; Many of these songs are still under copyright. Which means to put on Spotify or even Bandcamp, you need to buy a "mechanical license" and pay dues for every listen. We didn't feel like doing that. Our main goal was for friends and family to be able to listen to the music easily. In the future, I might put more time writing my own tunes so I can record and release those instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you still playing with your bandmates? &lt;/b&gt;Sadly, no! Leon is 
in California and Noé has moved back to France. Etienne and I are still 
in Kaohsiung, and we play ping pong on the regular. Life is ephemeral. So too is the syzygy required for music creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who recorded and edited the album? &lt;/b&gt;Vincent Tsai graciously 
helped record, edit and master the recording. We also used his studio space for rehearsals. He works as a composer for some video games and is a 
sound technician at different venues in Kaohsiung City. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will you make more albums? What are you working on right now? &lt;/b&gt;I loved making this album. It as fascinating to be part of the creative process from start to finish and see what professional musicians do on the regular. So I certainly want to do it in the future. For now, though, I'm on a break with the saxophone. I've been learning guitar and singing in the evenings. I'm sure my woodwind life will pick up again when the time is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's your favorite part? &lt;/b&gt;These are all jazz standards -- classics in the literature of jazz music -- that I love. And we put great effort into all of them. I've written some additional commentary below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;All of Me.&lt;/i&gt; I play flute! Flute is hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;All the Things You Are.&lt;/i&gt; A real famous standard. Etienne does a great intro on guitar and play-through of the head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bye-Bye Blackbird. &lt;/i&gt;A great choice by Leon. It's upbeat and jives!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Days of Wine and Roses.&lt;/i&gt; A truly beautiful intro, Bill Evans-style, by Leon on the piano. I jump in during the last minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Footprints.&lt;/i&gt; This song is written by a saxophonist, Wayne Shorter, so it's big "footprints" to step into. I'm proud of my tone and phrasing for the lyrical head. It's a great song to improvise on! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Four on Six.&lt;/i&gt; This song is groovy! I don't play on it; felt like a rhythm section thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Green Dolphin Street.&lt;/i&gt; I loved this song. It was an intense soloing moment. You'll hear some screeching and loud multiphonics on my horn in both takes. I loved playing off Noé's drum crashes. My one critique of myself is that it wasn't loud and abrasive enough! So I'll be working on that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just Friends&lt;/i&gt;. Leon sings the head and scats on this! I haven't accompanied a singer on the saxophone before (you can probably tell). I enjoyed the song and felt energized soloing! It has familiar chords and structure which made it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Line for Lyons.&lt;/i&gt; A really fantastic tune. Probably my favorite head in this whole set. Happy to sink in the pocket with Etienne. Guitar + saxophone is a great combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Little Suede Shoes&lt;/i&gt;. It's a classic by Charlie Parker. A catchy, relaxing head. My mother listens to it so much, I'm happy to have my own version out there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sandu&lt;/i&gt;. Another song where the head is a duet with Etienne and myself. I played this song for an audition way back in high school, but actually struggled with the (relatively simple, blue-form) melody. It swings great and is bluesey. Great soloing by Etienne and me I think. Worth listening the whole way through!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Sunny Side of the Street.&lt;/i&gt; I do a slow intro on this song, and sing towards the end. We were going for a "New Orleans"-style blues towards the end. Hence my singing in the crackled voice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-light-theme" id="simple-translate"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-button isShow" style="background-image: url(&amp;quot;moz-extension://51173a79-5a5d-42fd-a1bd-54c53162968d/icons/512.png&amp;quot;); height: 22px; left: 93px; top: 179px; width: 22px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-panel " style="font-size: 13px; height: 200px; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-wrapper" style="overflow: hidden;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-move" draggable="true"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-contents"&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-result" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-candidate" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/3901196335287877643/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/11/band-album-is-out.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3901196335287877643'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3901196335287877643'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/11/band-album-is-out.html' title='補習BAND the album is out'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-3110371231121805896</id><published>2023-11-09T08:04:00.007-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-09T08:16:23.717-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Wayne Hsiung, CODA, Lin Yun-ju, and other assorted thoughts</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;I like this format.&lt;/b&gt; It certainly doesn't get my blog more views, but that's not the point. Some thoughts come to me and I need to write them down. If they're on my blog, rather than in my journal, I'm far more likely to look over them in the future. And a thought is best in its pithiest form. Why write a whole blog post for something when it can just be a paragraph?&lt;p&gt;That's not to say everything should be converted into a TikTok video. Or that every book should just be a series of articles. Many messages are better as a train of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hats off to Wayne Hsiung.&lt;/b&gt; His recent blogpost from prison is &lt;a href="https://blog.simpleheart.org/p/the-transformative-power-of-suffering" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and here's my summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;50sq-ft studio apartment in Sonoma County. Fully furnished, natural lighting, minimalist design. Amenities include laundry, vegan catering, and pet fruit flies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to say, the worst part of prison seems to be the solitude. There's nothing like being alone with yourself and your thoughts. That's the real prison. Out in the world, you can distract yourself with work, people, nights out. But in a prison cell, you have nothing but yourself. Some days I'm stuck at home with nothing to do and feel bored. But I have the infinite books, TV, and music; I can call anyone I want at any time. Wayne's leisure is confined to thirty minutes a day to fit in calls and library visits. I'm sure he can get a lot of writing done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Should I not eat vegan junkfood? &lt;/b&gt;My friend Truman recently made me think more about adopting the whole-food plant-based diet. Truman is vegan and avoids basically all oil, saturated fat, and GMO foods. All I can say for now is I'm thinking about it. In Taiwan, I don't cook my own food, and it'd be a hassle to start. But he made some compelling points. I wonder what the difference is, though, between having a bit of oil and cutting it all out. I've heard qualitative descriptions, but not quantitative ones. I agree doing Michael Gregor's Daily Dozen and avoid vegan junk food is better. But I just don't know &lt;i&gt;how much&lt;/i&gt; better, and whether it's worth the hassle. It's both an empirical question and a judgement call about convenience vs. longetivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CODA &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a great movie. &lt;/b&gt;I watched it last weekend and loved it. It had me tearing up! But was so uplifting. I also learned a lot about deaf life and culture. My new favorite movie? Good song in it, too, &lt;i&gt;Both Sides Now&lt;/i&gt; by Joni Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1-1 ping pong coaching has outsized impact. &lt;/b&gt;Playing with a coach in ping pong, you get lots of feedback, fast. I'll do one movement and Coach will know exactly where I'm going wrong. Today we focused on my forehand drive. It's a shot where you need to put your hand down as soon as you know you're about to do it, so you have time to execute the full swing. That feedback is fantastic to get. It super-charges my next week or two of playing with things to think about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lin Yun-ju plays Ma Long in the World Table Tennis Championships. &lt;/b&gt;Lin Yun-ju, representing Taiwan, beats Ma Long (the Chinese world #1) four games to one. An incredible match. Incredible to see two world-class players in such intense combat. It reminds me of Federer's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federer%E2%80%93Nadal_rivalry" target="_blank"&gt;decade long fall&lt;/a&gt; to Nadal in tennis. Is this the beginning of such a saga? Lin Yun-ju keeps his cool; Ma Long doesn't take defeat well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-light-theme" id="simple-translate"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-button isShow" style="background-image: url(&amp;quot;moz-extension://51173a79-5a5d-42fd-a1bd-54c53162968d/icons/512.png&amp;quot;); height: 22px; left: -1px; top: 16px; width: 22px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-panel " style="font-size: 13px; height: 200px; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-wrapper" style="overflow: hidden;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-move" draggable="true"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-contents"&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-result" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-candidate" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/3110371231121805896/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/11/wayne-hsiung-coda-lin-yun-ju-and-other.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3110371231121805896'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3110371231121805896'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/11/wayne-hsiung-coda-lin-yun-ju-and-other.html' title='Wayne Hsiung, CODA, Lin Yun-ju, and other assorted thoughts'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-6268016492305920252</id><published>2023-10-28T09:47:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-28T09:47:32.653-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>AI and our futures</title><content type='html'>&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;
Let’s first talk about the things LLMs (large language models) can
do at this point. OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude can
write high school essays convincingly, perform at the 88&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;
%ile on the LSAT, write music, summarize literature, generate ideas
for art and wellness, plan a trip to most places on earth, write a
computer scripts in any programming language, tell jokes in any
language, write assessments and example readings, imitate the voice
and knowledge of people (real and fictional), and help you write a
story. Now, that’s a lot. I personally have only been interfacing
with the free ChatGPT 3.5, but it’s good enough at all those things
to be useful. And – as these chat bots will tell you – they’re
available 24/7 and do basically everyone of the above things
incredibly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;	Right
now, ChatGPT is confined to a chat prompt window. But what happens
when it can access your calendar and email and write emails for you?
What happens when it can read your code base and can debug
system-specific problems? What happens when it can be a personal
tutor for anything that can be learned about on the internet? What if
it remembers everything you’ve told it and becomes a best friend?
These are only simple extensions of the core technology of LLMs, yet
they can (and will) be incredibly transformative. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;	The
best example of this right now I think is Khanmigo from KhanAcademy.
From what I can see, they’ve taken ChatGPT and given it specific
contexts and prompts so that it’s tailored for tutoring. In math,
say, it can walk with you step by step through an algebra problem and
answer questions about why some things work, and some things don’t.
It can do the same thing for coding; it can pretend to be literary
characters for English class. It is a personal tutor for a fraction
of the cost and 100x the versatility. KhanAcademy is on the cutting
edge, just like they were with the advent of YouTube (and by the way,
they should be getting tons of government money for this). Maybe not
every other organization can keep up. But in my eyes, LLM’s are so
general purpose, it’s so hard to justify &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;	Then
imagine the next version of ChatGPT, or extensions on these
capabilities. Surely it could make an executive summary slideshow.
Surely it could write simple legal documents. Surely it could do
medical diagnoses. But could it build and launch entire websites just
given a sentence as a prompt? Could it edit videos and create graphic
animations? Could it start and run an entire company? These
capacities have improved so rapidly thus far, it’s hard for me to
think that these things are wildly out of the scope of possibilities.
Of course, LLMs drawbacks so far have been the occasional
“hallucinations” and self-contradictions. But its brain gets
bigger, I imagine that it’s tendency to do silly mistakes will
decrease. And possibly, it will become better at performing
multi-step tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;	These
technological capabilities sound magical and liberating. But in
practice, who gains from its deployment? The winners and losers from
this AI-based cognitive revolution is a social question. Will
AI-usage be like broadband or oil – prices marked up because of
selfish oligopolies? Or will AI take the social media model –
selling ads, personal information, and eyeballs to subsidize costs?
Or do we treat LLM-access like drinking water or food security, a
basic human necessity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;	Another
question: how do we manage an absurdly powerful surge of automation?
You can imagine that with a highly-trusted, enhanced hypothetical
ChatGPT 6, countless jobs could be made obsolete: accountants,
programmers, designers, lawyers, doctors, scientists, consultants,
investors. Some say that within ten years, any job that can be done
remotely will be feasibly automated by AI. Yet hopefully, we ought
not to fear such a transition as long as we’re flexible. In the
past, most of humanity was devoted to hunter-gathering; then later,
agriculture; and now (in certain countries), cognitive tasks. The
next technological revolution – which could be as transformative as
the industrial revolution – might mean we place more value on
emotional labor, human-to-human contact. Teaching, care-taking,
activism, governance. In a perfect world, we could all learn longer,
retire early, and work in areas we find more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;	And
here’s a hypothetical: what if LLMs could improve themselves? An
LLM would only need to be above-human at AI research – that
specific domain – to begin to engineer its own code-base. These
models are easily replicable, so once there’s one super-human AI
researcher it can copy itself and produce a billion plus
instantiations. And that means self-improving at an inhumanly fast
speed. AI might zoom from ChatGPT version 10 to version 20 to version
100 and beyond in a matter of weeks. Maybe limited by the amount of
compute and data it can gather. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	The
potential of such a thing is unfathomable. Self-improving AI &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
what they call in sci-fi the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;ingularity.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;ChatGPT-Infinity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;would be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;undoubtedly
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
enough to build physical manifestations of itself in the real world.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;It could build technology to
stop climate change, and put that technology in place with swarms of
microbots. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;It could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;make
incredible &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;cell-based meat
and end animal exploitation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;It
could be an international peace-keeper to end all &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;wars.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;But it could also be used by
rogue humans to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;launch atomic
weapons. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;It could start a
deadly pandemic to maximize the profits of a vaccine company. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;It
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;could – for its own
self-preservation – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;bulldoze
the planet to make solar panels so it never, ever shuts down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;	Though
they sound far-fetched, these are real possibilities if an AI became
super-intelligent. And they could become a reality very suddenly.
Hence the talk of the “alignment problem”: making sure
super-intelligent AI is onboard and aligned with humanity’s
interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;	I
don’t know what will happen. And I don’t have any real
prescriptions or recommendations at this point. All I can say it’s
going to be a whacky time over the next couple decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Endnote:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Honestly
speaking, AI has been a bewildering curveball for me since the
release of ChatGPT 3 (November 2022) and even before that with
Google’s LaMDA. I’ve been listening to podcasts, reading,
hypothesizing for a while about this. It is both threatening and
exciting to have the prospect of AI taking away “cognitive labor”
jobs as we know it. And I mentally don’t know how to process the
possibility of misaligned AI becoming a super-influential force on
the planet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;	It’s as if we
might soon enter a world of witchcraft and wizardry. It may be an
incredible thing, it may be a horrid thing, or it may be neutral. But
my hunch is that we’re at a tipping point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They don't necessarily have a great resolution or take-away message&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;That's why I'm sharing them on my blog.&lt;b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Core Memories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday my boss brought in over a hundred cookies for the kids to decorate at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You made all these?" I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah. I stacked them in the oven. It made me feel like I had a purpose while I was watching NBA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know, I remember decorating cookies at school when I was 6, too," I recounted. "We were learning fractions or something. I guess it was a great activity, since I still remember it, and I'm 23 now."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Corree memories. We're making core memories here," he replied. I chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crickets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, I had my last class with a group of students I taught in the afternoons. Three hours every Wednesday and Friday afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracy was a star student of that class. She was goofy and fun at breaktime. She loved songs like &lt;i&gt;Belle &lt;/i&gt;(from Beauty and the Beast) and &lt;i&gt;We Don't Talk About Bruno&lt;/i&gt; (from Enchanto) so much that she cherished the sheet with lyrics and told me to play it in one of our first classes. She made up new games that would combine leapfrog and Jenga blocks to play with her friends. And she'd patiently guide her classmate Owen through his homework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the kids moved classes, Tracy was in an evening class with teacher Bryan. The only other classmate was a rambunctious boy York. I'm friendly with Bryan -- he's tall, Mexican-American guy, and a good teacher. It's a couple months after this transition. I ask Bryan one Wednesday evening if I can stop by his class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sure," he says. "But they're deadly quiet. See if you can get them to talk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I go in with a ghoul mask. "YARRHGGHHH!!" &lt;i&gt;Crickets.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see York, and Tracy a couple seats down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"York, how you doing??"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Teacher, give me!" He points to the mask. I put it on his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I turn to Tracy and ask, "Tracy -- how are you??"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crickets.&lt;/i&gt; Tracy doesn't talk. She's hidden behind her mask, crouched in her seat. She doesn't even look at me. It's like we had a bad break-up and she's giving me the silent treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, I see her again waiting for a pickup outside the school.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tracy!" Another chance. "What will you be for Halloween?" Kids are better at responding to direct questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmmm, I don't know... Maybe a princess?" she responds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a lovely idea!" Then I whisper, "Teacher Bryan's class is so &lt;i&gt;quiet&lt;/i&gt;. Isn't it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes." Tracy says. "It's because... Teacher Bryan is scared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Teacher Bryan is scary?" I clarify. The words &lt;i&gt;scary &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;scared &lt;/i&gt;are easy to confuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She nods, "yes. Scary."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assure her it'll be okay. I can understand -- with class in the evening, a new teacher, new classmates, and only York tying her back to her previous English life, it's a big change. Teacher Bryan isn't scary to me, but maybe if you're 1/3 of his height, and have a much quieter voice, he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if we all go through these changes growing up. I remember being naughty and goofy as a little kid. Then, in middle school and high school, I became reserved and less confident. For me, it was a product of the social environment I was in. I vauled excelling in academics over having lots of fun with my friends. And now, maybe I'm a combination of both those states. I believe the bright, fun Tracy will shine in English again one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;He runs everyday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Teacher, my father wants to know how many km you run. He's a runner too," my student Brody tells me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met Brody's dad at an open house some time ago. I thought he was pretty cool. Brody's a great kid, and you're telling me his dad runs, too!? An inspiration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I run 5, or 6, or 7 km. Does your dad run every day?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes," says Brody. "Wait, no. He runs every week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a big difference!"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another student, Jerry, is a fast runner too. "Teacher, I run every year," he says jokingly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-lingual School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I'd have an upper-level do a project running a political campaign. I dreamt up some requirements: a poster and a speech. I taught some key words: &lt;i&gt;presidential campaign, political ideology.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My students are surprisingly into it. They're excited by the idea of crafting their own party name, logo, and policies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During work time, I realize some of the students are sitting on their butts. I take the role of back-seat project manager. While Linda's drawing on the posters, I tell Sam and Tina they should be writing better policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Momo, another student, wants to speak Mandarin. Because of our immersive English program, I've only heard her speak words and fragments in her native tongue. But then suddenly in Chinese, her words come tumbling out -- she wants her policy to be a multi-lingual school where kids can speak any language they want like Japanese or or Korean English or Chinese, like a bilingual program, but multi-lingual. She's excited and expressing her creativity! I've never seen her talk like this. And I'm suddenly unprepared how to support her idea. I simply tell her how to spell the word "languages" and that she should write down her idea.

You can sit in the dental chair and see the miniature chainsaw going inside you. You can sit still as a wrench is fixed on your tooth and it twists, twists, and all you feel is a slight cranking of your jaw. You can snort with laughter (and concern) at the fact that surgery is an art more than a science. You can wonder thirty minutes in whether the dentist is pulling out the wrong tooth, but then think that it's too late to ask. You can feel blood trickling down your throat and not know whether they actually nicked your tongue and are just good at covering it up. You can shout "nice catch!" when the third and last shard of your wisdom tooth falls out into your throat, but the dentist technician catches it with a heroic use of suction. You can marvel at how it only cost 50 NTD to get your mouth sliced open. You can go home right after and put your detached tooth right in the fridge, where it now belongs.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/7200862437478594670/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/10/chainsaws-and-chuckles.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7200862437478594670'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7200862437478594670'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/10/chainsaws-and-chuckles.html' title='Chainsaws and chuckles'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-639031872384502290</id><published>2023-10-04T07:25:00.006-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-07T12:37:52.572-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='review'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='personal'/><title type='text'>澎湖 The Penghu Islands</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt; I went to Penghu this weekend. It’s my new favorite place in
Taiwan, so here are some memories from the places I went to.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img class="detail__media__img-thumbnail js-detail-img js-detail-img-thumb" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.toTixt_ZYe6z2yFkFPwSdwHaHF%26pid%3DApi&amp;amp;f=1&amp;amp;ipt=8036036f0ab517a5e9b65890d191f21acf29a1959ada07e28c3ed29090eab876&amp;amp;ipo=images" style="height: 262px; width: 273.587px;" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a preface, I had a fair amount of anticipation for this trip. Even the map of Penghu reminds me of a Pokemon game. The island is mostly naturer, and scaled so that you can bike from Magong City to Shiyu Township in just 3-4 hours. So reasonable, but not so small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every part of Penghu, you're not so far from the water. Boats and bridges are essential forms of transport in the Penghu islands. Bridges connect the main island that Magong is on to Baisha Township, and the relatively new Penghu Great Bridge (1970) connects Baisha to Shiyu. For the other adorably small islands, you have to take a boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all makes Penghu so much more &lt;i&gt;lang4man4 &lt;/i&gt;(romantic) than I even thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;馬公 Magong&lt;/b&gt;. Though Magong is a city, the buildings are low and the people
are kind. There’s a Poya, 50 Lan, tons of 7-Elevens like everywhere
else in Taiwan. There’s also numerous lovely vegetarian places. I
had a solid meal at a Loving Hut. There’s a vegan breakfast place
near the ferry port that sells sandwiches and &lt;i&gt;fantuan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; (rice balls).
Two times I went to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;a
buffet-style restaurant, which is also all-vegan and open every day!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;My
friends, Don, Lily and Truman and I all went to a wonderful vegan
late-night tea shop. They’re open till midnight and rest on
Wednesdays. They have awesome noodles, a friendly &lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjBkkvtIsHY2fBbnzlNf6NxT0lZQHj4PCw_tFP8C5L-siIML-bbNZamXj30EJGE-1MVK6B30EqWooFliq3Fu4lwqaUVTBnxrDRsluvbhWeLDaqE1H27FrYq8QGN0yWcYCZ4X1R7h_l1FmvLLLekWyK89WWVdRyXoZc22_JMSXNKyV5zaOYLPP3LhXK_GbQ" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" data-original-height="966" data-original-width="1289" height="160" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjBkkvtIsHY2fBbnzlNf6NxT0lZQHj4PCw_tFP8C5L-siIML-bbNZamXj30EJGE-1MVK6B30EqWooFliq3Fu4lwqaUVTBnxrDRsluvbhWeLDaqE1H27FrYq8QGN0yWcYCZ4X1R7h_l1FmvLLLekWyK89WWVdRyXoZc22_JMSXNKyV5zaOYLPP3LhXK_GbQ=w213-h160" width="213" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;laoban&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;,

I went by myself and I'm glad I did, because I go through museums at a blitz-pace (1 hour for 2 floors). I learned that Penghu has archeological remains that date even before Taiwan. But most people didn't settle in Penghu because they realized it's damn hard to grow anything there when it's so windy in the winter. Most people made voyages to greener pastures in Kaohsiung or Pingtung. Fruits and vegetables are still mostly shipped to Penghu from Kaohsiung.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhytmcsTPYlAsQ2irS0dbhfYNQGlCKulDzfqgOuhkNb2G8g8IQ_Dpfrn5p9Ui5WEwySmhyAW2-QfvcivE6I43wuhhS2RMFdSSog5-gZuOIagApZNIROwLtgCH7l2Js6M3-o28c4kcRgNjsyjRkPL0_0w82psssXp1oR4AngtQ-4uP-nKaKhBZwZYgLnswY" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" data-original-height="951" data-original-width="714" height="177" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhytmcsTPYlAsQ2irS0dbhfYNQGlCKulDzfqgOuhkNb2G8g8IQ_Dpfrn5p9Ui5WEwySmhyAW2-QfvcivE6I43wuhhS2RMFdSSog5-gZuOIagApZNIROwLtgCH7l2Js6M3-o28c4kcRgNjsyjRkPL0_0w82psssXp1oR4AngtQ-4uP-nKaKhBZwZYgLnswY=w133-h177" width="133" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Another night, Don, Lily and I biked around. We saw a very tall statue of Mazu or the Buddha or Dao-incarnation or something. And we also saw the end of a rocking concert.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;People
in Penghu are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;willing to chat
and chat. My friend Truman was especially good at this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;There’s
no rush on Taiwan’s outlying islands. Magong provides a hub for the
collection that is Penghu, but at a relaxed pace. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;湖西 Husi&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Also on the same island as
Magong. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I went to this place
on my last full day. I had a guy staying in my hostel called Mumin.
He was really into kite surfing. Most people come to Penghu &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;during
the summer to avoid the fierce winds that come in the winter. But for
a kite surfer, Penghu in the winter is the perfect place to hone your
craft. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;It’s apparently the
best in Taiwan, and even draws international attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Mumin
invited me and Truman to go out to Husi with him &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;and
witness some real kite-surfing in action. Truman was hoping to join,
but it turns out that kitesurfing isn’t something you learn in an
afternoon. It took Mumin 3-4 years of kitesurfing on the weekends
when he lived in Japan to get to the point where he actually could.
That’s because in most places, kitesurfing is possible only
occasionally – the winds have to be strong and pointed inland (so
you’re not dangerously drawn out into the sea). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Kitesurfing
is also rather expensive to get started. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;It
costs about 6000-7000USD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;to
buy a decent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;kite and board.
And lessons can be almost 100USD an hour &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;(at
least with the people Mumin knew). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Truman

his break from the waves,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; Mumin told me about his life. He's Taiwanese and grew up in Taipei, but lived in
America for 10 years doing college and his masters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Then
he worked as a tour guide, then tour-bus driver in LA for a while. As
a bus driver he met his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;to-be-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;wife,
who is Japanese, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;and they
stayed in touch across the Pacific ocean. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;He
eventually moved back to Taiwan. It was then that he found a job
working for the US government gathering intelligence &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;through&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
open-source research in Mandarin/Chinese. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;The
job was a little dry. As someone not of American nationality, he’s
not able to get security clearance for anything cool. But his
information gathering contributed to the intelligence of the CIA. He
worked alongside Americans who were highly proficient in Chinese and
Japanese, some from the Mormon church. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;He
was able to be placed in Japan, but being on the US military base, he
didn’t have to know Japanese. He says that job was custom made for
him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Now, he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;works
part-time as a contracter. He spends the winter season in Penghu and
the other half of the year in Japan with his wife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;白沙和&lt;/span&gt;鳥嶼&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;aisha
and Niaoyu&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Truman
have gotten this word of this festival on an island called&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E9%B3%A5%E5%B6%BC%E7%A6%8F%E5%BE%B7%E5%AE%AE"&gt;Niaoyu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;. You have to take a boat from a spot in Baisha and take a 20-minute boat ride to get there. But the amount of 熱鬧 (&lt;i&gt;re4nao4&lt;/i&gt;, liveliness) apparently was unparalleled. Truman had been to a similar festival before and was excited to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;So my first day in Penghu, biked over to meet Truman at the dock and catch the next boat over. We had gotten the timings wrong so waited an hour for the next ride. When it did actually come, it turned out to be reserved for Penghu residents. Apparently, so many people were going to Niaoyu to watch the &lt;i&gt;re4nao4 -- &lt;/i&gt;the event was called "brother ceremony" that they couldn't let outsiders in just yet. We decided to try again the next day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	The
next day we were successful in getting on the boat. It was in fact
due to the kindness, or sympathy, of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;the
lady manning the dock. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;She
saw we had come two days in a row, eager as ever to get to this
event, and so saved us have two seats. We got to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Niaoyu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
island after much anticipation. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	The
Brother Ceremony was one of the most bizarre religious events I’ve
ever seen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;There were bright,
dyed fireworks outside &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;the
temple and loud cracking noises from the detonations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;The
speakers from the temple could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;be
heard literally throughout the island. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;The
temple was crowded with devotees from Niaoyu itself &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;but
also other nearby islands. Maybe that has something to do with the
“brother” part of the Brother Ceremony.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgJ1w0Kn-MmLLt7wa7Gk66l1yE4_Md1w_GWQ94xINdGpGF9BsQ_0ukfSxRTMMhxid0H3XkDtSedikVnt6BSsTSztG5rhqRcRV0YJ9FPWg--V3Yywm1xLx11G41TGvR0sZCuT3nUri8bYJArz3iSp_syaVdjI6yK-W0GWng0hO6poXlxhnX8Ni_wppFeNK8" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" data-original-height="951" data-original-width="1268" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgJ1w0Kn-MmLLt7wa7Gk66l1yE4_Md1w_GWQ94xINdGpGF9BsQ_0ukfSxRTMMhxid0H3XkDtSedikVnt6BSsTSztG5rhqRcRV0YJ9FPWg--V3Yywm1xLx11G41TGvR0sZCuT3nUri8bYJArz3iSp_syaVdjI6yK-W0GWng0hO6poXlxhnX8Ni_wppFeNK8" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Truman
and I pushed our way through the crowd. It wasn’t hard because
people were sapped from the force of the Penghu sun. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Inside
the temple were three men dressed in red and gold gowns. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Two
were old and pudgy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;One was
young, relatively – maybe 40-50 years old. &lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhzcOWX1lib3RG0GvR3ZRweJ3MJpsfHYbaS3qZpWrqRmL3Mo5337imWQsNnRCgAXXirsUX364X6iv0ODcuhRYNnss9QDYkv-bv56J8OThNbQrg9j19tvGOWcZBPKwjzyZ1kIiv22NMjfCvySxDND7gg57nre-xh_rjyL6V-W_dPeioqgSI0Hq02DBbvuOM" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" data-original-height="951" data-original-width="1268" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhzcOWX1lib3RG0GvR3ZRweJ3MJpsfHYbaS3qZpWrqRmL3Mo5337imWQsNnRCgAXXirsUX364X6iv0ODcuhRYNnss9QDYkv-bv56J8OThNbQrg9j19tvGOWcZBPKwjzyZ1kIiv22NMjfCvySxDND7gg57nre-xh_rjyL6V-W_dPeioqgSI0Hq02DBbvuOM" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;They
all had blood flowing from their foreheads. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;They
all were salivating. And they all looked like they were about to pass
out. I was somewhat prepared for this but god, it was still
flabbergasting to see people that really believed they were possessed
by god. In fact it looked like they had rabbies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Drums
beat loudly. The younger man sometimes danced. But he mainly knelt &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;in
a supporters arms, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;eyes
half-closed and shaking his body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;The
ceremony concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;There was another part where other old dudes dressed in more costumes -- this time, like the gowns of men in the Qing Dynasty, and did other stuff. Let me tell you it's weird to see this shit in the 21st century. And let's not forget that the Daoist Temple, like any other nonprofit, has many hired camera-folk so that the donors don't forget that it happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Truman
and I then walked around and looked for vegan food on the island. We
had packed food with us, but Truman said he wanted to walk around
partially to take a chance to chat with people and small talk. Most
people’s responses were that there was absolutely nothing that was
vegan on the island. Because of this religious event, which happens
on such a scale only once every 15 years, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;all
restaurants were closed. But we managed to grab some free fruit that
some shop was giving out. Truman is the master of small talking to
the point of getting free food. But he does it I believe out of
curiousity. As we ate the fruit, a man asked me where I’m from, and
I told him Egypt. Truman couldn’t keep a straight face. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	Truman
had met a man named Mr. Chen on another island at a similar religious
ceremony. We saw Mr. Chen on the street chatting to some people he
knew in Niaoyu. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Since it was
the Mid-Autumn Festival, many people were visiting Penghu from
mainland Taiwan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Two brothers
and their little cousin starting chatting to me. They’re
conversation starter was, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;ni3hao3shuai4e!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;(you’re so handsome!) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I
smiled and partook in the conversation. One of the brothers was 23
like me. He had enrolled in the air force for college and trained as
an army cook. He said it paid well, about 30-40kNTD a month, and
that’s just for a beginner position. But it’s hard work. I asked
him how much he thinks an air force pilot makes (which is what my
manager’s husband does). He said 200k+NTD a month, which is a very
large amount here. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Anyways,
we talked with these boys and their little cousin, a cute 8-year-old
girl growing up in Taipei. She told us &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;about
the boys at school and how they’re really stupid. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;She
said they tease her and then she hits them and then they chase her.
It sounded like an ideal childhood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;西嶼 (Shiyu)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;.
I only went past Baisha to the other islands once. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgAUf1Gl4z_NIwDCcU7Il6u-D7qw7GcMFu7f8rZTHfuEqtcIy_rdTB6tgUh26JxQY9VDqcdXTVhwiyNH0IhDZBzlCj9-imNHQmdnyJ-MUzd2KtpZ0E3nf_Ko20MjczLdeeNHJSV1omL5jL4ayt1D_EGZsFq3ZL4e3jt-OiZ9ckhASYztnLaAss6OG3tdgE" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" data-original-height="951" data-original-width="1268" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgAUf1Gl4z_NIwDCcU7Il6u-D7qw7GcMFu7f8rZTHfuEqtcIy_rdTB6tgUh26JxQY9VDqcdXTVhwiyNH0IhDZBzlCj9-imNHQmdnyJ-MUzd2KtpZ0E3nf_Ko20MjczLdeeNHJSV1omL5jL4ayt1D_EGZsFq3ZL4e3jt-OiZ9ckhASYztnLaAss6OG3tdgE" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;When
we gave up on taking the ferry to Niaoyu, Truman and I rode on his
scooter out to where he was staying in Xiyu. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Xiyu
was beautiful. There are so many beaches there and natural sites.
Notably is Renkan, an old city that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;reminded
me of Roman ruins. It’s not that old. The houses are made of brick
and there are merchants selling random stuff there. We bought &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;cactus
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;ice cream (or sorbet)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;,
which turned out to be vegan, from a lady who used to host a show for
a broadcasting channel that spotlighted vegan restaurants all around
Taiwan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;She was very pretty,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;had that broadcasting host
face. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;After grabbing cactus
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;ice cream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
we went to the very tip of Xiyu which had &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;another &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;ice
cream store. Truman knew the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;laoban&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
there, too, a nice chap &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;who
told us how his fruit ice creams are made. Many flavors were also
vegan. Truman met him before and we talked so long that he also gave

last thing I did in Xiyu was snork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;ing.
I didn’t quite get the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;hang
of the breathing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Maybe the
angle of my breathing tube wasn’t quite right, so it kept filling
with water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;So
I favored just wearing the goggles and taking breaths like a normal
swimmer (shout-out to mom and dad for forcing me to go to swimming
class Wednesday evenings &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;at
Willesden Sports Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;The
coral was colorful, magnificent, alien. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;It
was big and sharp and I had to be careful not to graze it doing
front-crawl. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;That day I took
a bus back to Magong and was glad to have a night of rest back at my
hostel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;澎湖倫 The Penghu Ferry&lt;/b&gt;. This boat is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;a thing

Taihwa was also often docked at the Kaohsiung port and to Lily, and
another friend Penny, it sparked wonder and fascination. They dreamed
one day it could take them to the far away island that is Penghu. It
turns out that whatever company owned it found a buyer for the
Taihwa. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;They sold it and
somehow it got to be dissembled in Bangalore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the &lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Penghu
 Ferry is like a palace. There's flat-screen TV, beds you can rent on to
 sleep, reclining chairs, and a small store to buy food. In the bottom, 
there's space for bikes, cars, vans, and food -- whatever needs to be 
shipped from Kaohsiung to Penghu. It also has the distinctive smell of 
beetelnut and oil. When you're on the boat, footing is unsteady in the 
subtlest of ways -- you can't quite tell which way the waves are going, 
but when you get on land things feel less sway-ey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjDDfkp1leH_c4w6hgRTBdYNGFteabb239NtMdsNd42VFwa6WgKis_ZE6KXEVyEYo9zOrOthbaYC11hpiYVow8QXCV-yohMvyIrEWgqGLNcb709Xph2NZlrm7xyOJ2hx-S4m24MfEK1_2zb__lO6RMSXXsU5XSHKrlqMkunOP6Xy7siUkljcEje9A7-u_E" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" data-original-height="951" data-original-width="1268" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjDDfkp1leH_c4w6hgRTBdYNGFteabb239NtMdsNd42VFwa6WgKis_ZE6KXEVyEYo9zOrOthbaYC11hpiYVow8QXCV-yohMvyIrEWgqGLNcb709Xph2NZlrm7xyOJ2hx-S4m24MfEK1_2zb__lO6RMSXXsU5XSHKrlqMkunOP6Xy7siUkljcEje9A7-u_E" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjLmr-PHaeOVNyZmOkZ8BKjvnjWiKDftFACZACqXnMNr8_McifYdvmlV_BrwPVhagFnV2VBUbZO8G_NxaIsmNh6GoBwAaqkE-USHME9sqgu7dQap9CkBE_0DsRa6ltJjbbbP3hG64CD945pQpZgeOVJLHOv5dJSp2P0pXLmsi0HMR1bKM-ZW29_CfPqE44" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" data-original-height="951" data-original-width="714" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjLmr-PHaeOVNyZmOkZ8BKjvnjWiKDftFACZACqXnMNr8_McifYdvmlV_BrwPVhagFnV2VBUbZO8G_NxaIsmNh6GoBwAaqkE-USHME9sqgu7dQap9CkBE_0DsRa6ltJjbbbP3hG64CD945pQpZgeOVJLHOv5dJSp2P0pXLmsi0HMR1bKM-ZW29_CfPqE44" width="180" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;On
 the way back, I took an evening boat. I stood on top deck and other 
Kaohsiungers who went to Penghu for the long weekend. My friends Don and
 Lily watched the boat from Magong recede into the horizon. The sunset 
illuminated the ocean, and I saw the disappearing outline of the Penghu 
islands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/639031872384502290/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/10/penghu-islands.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/639031872384502290'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/639031872384502290'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/10/penghu-islands.html' title='澎湖 The Penghu Islands'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjBkkvtIsHY2fBbnzlNf6NxT0lZQHj4PCw_tFP8C5L-siIML-bbNZamXj30EJGE-1MVK6B30EqWooFliq3Fu4lwqaUVTBnxrDRsluvbhWeLDaqE1H27FrYq8QGN0yWcYCZ4X1R7h_l1FmvLLLekWyK89WWVdRyXoZc22_JMSXNKyV5zaOYLPP3LhXK_GbQ=s72-w213-c-h160' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-4127804036468406697</id><published>2023-09-26T03:18:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2023-09-26T03:18:10.096-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>assorted ideas 2023-09</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I wrote in December 2020 on the topic of "cyborgs at the Harkness table". The piece was meant to show how though our brains do a lot of valuable thinking, we're almost always augmented by cognitive tools: the internet, a calculator, even a pen and paper. These tools help us record information, calculate, or access information that isn't stored in our heads. I find it necessary to revisit this topic with the advent of large language models. In the near future, brilliant innovations -- technologically and artistically -- will come from AI. The greatest case of this is AI playing chess. AI defeated the world's best human player, Gary Kasparov, in 1997. Since then, humans still play chess, but the game has changed. We no longer have to do research like we used to. We can consult chess algorithms, who innovate and develop strategies that world-class players can use. A human chess player's job is to learn and deploy these strategies that may never have been invented without computers. How does this relate to cyborgs and the Harkness table? Well, before, computers were there to augment the cognitive brilliance of the human mind. The computer did the grunt work of information storage or retrieval; humans did the hard thinking. Now, or soon, artificial minds will be the greatest writers, musicians, literary critics, and philosophers. The cyborgs will no longer be needed at the Harkness table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The podcast &lt;i&gt;Conversations with Tyler &lt;/i&gt;has taught me how to ask better questions. Tyler asks questions that strike at someone's individual experience, yet still illuminate broader problems. I won't give examples, just go listen to almost any episode you're interested in. He also doesn't linger on questions, even if the answer is a little wishy-washy. That's a great strategy. If someone hasn't answered a question, they probably don't know and are too shy to say so. And also, Tyler rarely lingers on topics that he wants to share &lt;i&gt;his &lt;/i&gt;opinion on. He focuses the interview on the other person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of questions, there are two types of questions I find vile for conversation. One is the &lt;i&gt;first date question&lt;/i&gt;. These are questions that the other person has likely heard hundreds or thousands of times before, like "where did you grow up? what do your parents do? do you have any siblings?" Gosh, they're hard to avoid, but it's so worth it. If someone's giving you a canned answer, they probably don't find talking to you very interesting. The second kind of vile question is the &lt;i&gt;uncle question&lt;/i&gt;. This is a question about the future that the person can't possibly know the answer to. You go to a job interview, and after it a friend asks, "so you think you got the job?" You meet someone who's asking you about what you do (for work), and then they say, "so, what's next?" Or another form of the &lt;i&gt;uncle question&lt;/i&gt; is a comparative -- "do you like living in CA or NYC better?" "Do you think X partner is the one?" They're loaded questions with a whole lot of factors. As tempting as it is to want to know the future, no one does. Asking about it doesn't help (why not ask a Magic 8 Ball?). If you want to ask one of these vile questions, you should probably acknowledge how uncreative it is by saying, "I know you may have been asked this question a hundred times before, but... or, I know this question will probably stress you out and you, at the moment, have no good answer to it, but..." And then ask your question if you really feel the need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been requested by a couple people to receive email notifications from these blogs. I'm honored by this question, because it means that you want to keep up-to-date on these musings. I have looked high and low for other free, easy-to-update blogging solutions (that can also be linked to a custom domain name) and Blogger doesn't seem like a bad option for now. I'm also considering Notion, but that's a whole thing. However, one alternative is to use an RSS reader, like this one &lt;a href="https://rss.app/feed/8dGOoL3JDRyDadUa"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and put in the information of this blog. Since RSS isn't a common tool these days, that's probably more trouble than it's worth. But I thought I'd mention it. I also know there are some friends (shout-out my parents, Tynan, Shaurya, and Setu!), who check this website every now and then and catch up on old posts. I'm grateful for the readership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to test for a scooter license today in Kaohsiung. Turns out you need to schedule these things in advance, so I was only able to take a 2-hour traffic safety course. I haven't often had to sit in a chair and passively listen since I graduated from college. So this was a welcome experience. Part of it was done by a real instructor who went through the 8-section course that constitutes the actual test. Then there was a video about driving safely. It was actually a video about driving dangerously. There were doctors and parents and whatnot talking about scooter deaths, vegetablization, the impact on families, things like that. I found it worthwhile and the videos of traffic accidents rather gripping. I think I paid more attention than I would've for an analogous course in the US/UK. I considered it great Chinese practice -- they spoke in crisp Mandarin, had Chinese subtitles, and was relevant content for my near-future. But after watching the video, I felt like not driving a scooter at all. With the high speeds and unprotected body, it seems like the most dangerous thing I can do in my day-to-day life. The most life-threatening thing in my life right now is riding a bicycle (I'm loathe to give that up). So although I may take this famous exam (appointment on October 17th!), you won't find me driving too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final point. Phone numbers. They're outdated, insecure, and stupid. In Taiwan especially, everyone uses LINE (which is a commercialized clunky software, but anyways). If I was president of the world for a day, I would have everyone register a public contact number. It'd be like a social security number, but actually something you could give out if you need to be contacted or identified. Banks, hotels, organizations could contact you for anything through it. It'd be encrypted and linked to your official national ID so no one could ever hack into it. And it could notify you through a variety of applications. Email is close to this, but don't so many people have something like "pudgywudgy123" as they're account name? And phone numbers -- no, no, no. Foolish. People change phone numbers all the time. Same with zip codes and addresses. Some things are so simple yet so hard to get organized in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the right structure for a blog post? What are the key 
ingredients? Does a blog post need to have a point? For me a) there is 
no right structure b) there are no key ingredients c) no.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been writing some longer pieces recently, and I find it 
extremely difficult. It's one thing to have an idea and turn it into a 
blogpost. The standards here are very low. To me, the important part of 
blogging is that I write something in the first place. Basically 
whatever I write is better than nothing. For essays, however, it's so 
crazily difficult to get stuck in an perfectionist trap. You write a 
bit, then think about how it could be phrased better, then write it 
again. Then you think about how the reader will read it, so you write it
 once more. Then you look at a whole finished page and decide that from 
the outset, the idea of the piece is bland and not even worth writing 
this way. It's going to take another draft. Then do that for 5-10 pages 
and you have one essay, or one chapter of a book. I can understand 
writers getting writer's block. I can understand people taking years to 
write a book that they're proud of. And then it might be consumed by a 
reader within a week. At the same time, writing something great is one 
of the greatest gifts you can leave the world (along with recording 
great music). A friend I had in college was a big reader of political 
philosophy. He said when he looked at his shelf, with those works by 
Kant and Foucault and Bentham lined up, he could imagine their voices 
calling out to him, even hundreds of years after their passing. Soon 
with large language models, we will be able to pose original questions 
to AI imitating writers who are long dead. Is it immortality that I 
crave when writing? Or, how shy I am of sharing my pieces, is it just 
the act of representing myself in text that feels valuable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-light-theme" id="simple-translate"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-button isShow" style="background-image: url(&amp;quot;moz-extension://51173a79-5a5d-42fd-a1bd-54c53162968d/icons/512.png&amp;quot;); height: 22px; left: 657px; top: 237px; width: 22px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-panel " style="font-size: 13px; height: 200px; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-wrapper" style="overflow: hidden;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-move" draggable="true"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-contents"&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-result" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-candidate" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/4127804036468406697/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/09/assorted-ideas-2023-09.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4127804036468406697'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4127804036468406697'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/09/assorted-ideas-2023-09.html' title='assorted ideas 2023-09'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-7783652605247768817</id><published>2023-08-01T01:29:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2023-08-01T01:29:40.363-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>english is superfluous</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I've realized that English has more curtesies than I had previously thought. Let me give some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;English: "Hey Jonathan! Any chance you might be free on Thursday evening for dinner? I will be in the area so thought I might ask :). No worries if you've got something else going on, or will be too tired from work. We can always meet another time! Hope all is well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning: "thursday dinner yes or no?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;English: "Hi everyone! Hope you're having a great start to your Monday. I just realized I had something come up in the afternoon, so it will be hard for me to make the meeting we have. Let me know if there's any way I can help though! I'll make sure to read the notes after. See you all soon!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning: "i can't make the meeting today"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;English: "Hey Johnny! So sorry to bother you, but I've just got a word from Sharon that we need to add some extra slides to the Powerpoint for the client. I've got a full plate today and tomorrow, and since the presentation is Wednesday, do you think you could manage to do that for me? It would be a huge help. Thanks so much."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning: "make slides by wed."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, now, you might be saying that all this superfluous add-on information isn't strictly necessary. Sure, not for super close friends or people you work with very closely. But in most situations I think that amount of buffer isn't unreasonable. Otherwise, you risk being considered rude, terse, or informal. I recently watched a woman on a plane spend several hours writing messages like the English above, and not doing actual object-level work at all.

But you can read more below :).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, I welcome updates -- long or short -- back in return! I'm ever-curious to hear what's new and old and everything in between.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohan&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changes and Continuities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big change this year is my good friend Leon, who moved with me from Berkeley, is going back to California. He couldn't stay in Taiwan longer than a year because of complications with the military service here. But I'm happy to have some friends in the city from before, so starting off again won't be as challenging as last year. I've also moved apartments, so I have Taiwanese flatmates and a new neighborhood to hang about. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaohsiung is a great place and I'm happy to be here for another 
year. I enjoy the nature in southern Taiwan, the warm weather and the warm people you find there. Taiwan is so small yet has so much to see -- the beautiful east coast, the outlying islands, and the mountains. So to me there's more than enough to see in my next year here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be teaching at the same &lt;i&gt;buxiban&lt;/i&gt;, an afterschool English center for kids. Many of my kids will be the same as last year, just going on to more advanced material. But I'm also starting an "ABC class" (complete beginners, maybe age 7)! Of course, with my training right from the start, they'll be reading the New Yorker within a few months!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoy my job more and more as I do it. With more experience, I feel more able to relax into the work. There's lots of creative activities that kids enjoy, but I've learned that kids like a degree of ritual. We play the same games and dance to the same songs (typically Blackpink) again and again. It's wonderful to get to know my students and see them improve, learn their personalities and strengths and weaknesses. When we watch movies like Lion King or Spiderman I feel like I'm going through these experiences with them with fresh eyes. All in all, my students are lucky to grow up in a place like Taiwan, and I'm grateful to be part of their lives as they grow up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've gotten to a good place in my Chinese level, one that I'm happy with for the time being. I can have long conversations in Mandarin; I can watch TV and listen to some podcasts; I can negotiate rent with my new landlord in Chinese. I also see my limits -- reading news articles, listening to super fast conversations among native speakers are beyond my abilities. But I don't mind that so much, because after all I do speak English. When I first came to Taiwan it felt like my every bit of free time could and should be spent learning Chinese, because the potential future benefits felt boundless. Nowadays I feel less confident that I'll use Chinese directly for work in the future (especially given how intense work culture is in Asia). For now I'm rather happy chatting to the guy who sells me bananas or people in my ping pong class. Speaking Chinese is a great tool in my toolkit, and it's given me a new perspective on what non-native English speakers experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Travels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been lucky to travel a few places since the new year. At the end of January, I went to Thailand and India with my parents. We stayed in Bangkok for three days and saw more Buddhist temples than I could count. Bangkok was a cool city -- they have an awesome boat system on the river that you can take to many places. In India we went to Chennai where I saw my grandmother. She's over ninety and still kickin'. It had a been about three years since I had seen her so I was happy to do that. India and Taiwan are vastly different places -- me and my parents alike were unused to the level of chaos that one experiences getting around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend Andrew visited Taiwan after that and did a grand tour of the island. Andrew found places I had never heard of, like the &lt;a href="https://www.rtaiwanr.com/east-rift-valley/fuyuan-butterfly-valley" target="_blank"&gt;Fuyuan Butterfly Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and some I had, like the Taroko Gorge National Park. We made great use of Taiwan's epic train system, affordable hostels, and epic vegetarian restaurants. Also in Taiwan, I recently went to Jiufen, a city near Taipei that is the inspiration for the setting of &lt;i&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/i&gt;. And on my birthday I went to Green Island, a former penal colony that is indeed very green.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the Dragon Boat Festival I went to Shanghai to see my friends Hanji and Shuge from Berkeley. I was lucky they were both there to take me around and let me meet their friends. Shanghai is a large, large city. Its population is 23 million, more than twice that of New York City, and it has a sprawling underground with 408 stations and many more planned in the next decade. Shanghai was also remarkable in terms of green transportation -- 99% of mopeds I saw were electric, and about half of cars were, too. It makes quiet, exhaust-free transport. China also has the world's largest high-speed-rail network which I used to go to Hangzhou. It's fast and much cheaper than the one in Taiwan. Life is good in China in these ways. Though I was unaccustomed to the number of security cameras, prevalence of online payment (frustrating because I couldn't use it as a short-stay foreigner!), and Chinese Mandarin accents. Though geographically and linguistically close to Taiwan, China felt very foreign to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fun things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After playing with my friend Etienne at his house for a few weeks, we decided to go in on group ping pong lessons near where I live in Kaohsiung. I played recreationally as a kid with my old neighbor John. I'd consider myself pretty good, even if I never had formal training. Taking lessons, though, has made me realize there's a whole lot more to ping pong. We started correcting my basic form, which I realized had a whole lot of problems, and as I've improved the coaches teach me more advanced techniques. There's something special about whacking a ping pong ball and sending it to the exact place that you wish it to go, and spin the way you want to. At the highest levels, every rally feels like a fast-paced chess match, each hit being a thought-out move on the board. I've written a couple blog posts on this topic!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've also started learning guitar. The initial motivation was to learn an instrument that's more harmony/rhythm based, a weak spot in my music skills. Guitar is fascinating -- to me, the fretboard and fingerings seems very geometric and logical, the way everything is laid out. It's a good exercise for muscle memory to learn the chords properly. And also to sing a melody, finger the chords and strum has proved to be challenging! But also means I have lots of room for improvement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With my friends Etienne, Leon, and another friend Noé, I recorded a jazz album! It was quite the musical experience. We recorded 13 jazz standards that we had been practicing for a few months. Each took one to four takes, which is why the process was so exhausting -- our own standards for perfection were self-defeating. Knowing that every note/sound would be recorded made playing much harder. And having the pressure of recording all the songs we wanted to do in one day was difficult too. Anyways, the music is still in the mastering process. When it's ready, I think we'll put it on Bandcamp (and it probably deserves another blog post). I hope to record again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/4969020429625260590/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/08/2023-08-semiannual-update.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4969020429625260590'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4969020429625260590'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/08/2023-08-semiannual-update.html' title='2023-08 Semiannual Update'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-4954912402193662177</id><published>2023-07-31T23:46:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2023-07-31T23:46:46.632-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>me sitting at a desk</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Normally I really hate sitting down for long periods of time. Sitting is important for lots of things like preparing for tests, having coffee with people, sending emails, journalling, etc. I enjoy those things and can tolerate sitting for a little bit like that. But when I think about the monumentous task of doing something for many hours at end, day after day at a desk it's rather daunting. Sitting at end also has bad health effects on metabolism and such. It's said (by me) that sitting might even be the new smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exception to my dislike of sitting is when I'm reading a book I really like. I've recently been reading the Mistborn trilogy; a fantasy series about a magical feudal kingdom. There's something about the escapism of fantasy that lets me forget everything else going and become obsessed with learning about the plot of the story. So maybe I can sit after all, I just need something enrapturing enough to do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/4954912402193662177/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/07/me-sitting-at-desk.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4954912402193662177'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4954912402193662177'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/07/me-sitting-at-desk.html' title='me sitting at a desk'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-3498062871670117108</id><published>2023-07-31T23:05:00.005-07:00</published><updated>2023-07-31T23:05:34.076-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>the biannual update</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;it's coming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/3498062871670117108/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/07/the-biannual-update.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3498062871670117108'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3498062871670117108'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/07/the-biannual-update.html' title='the biannual update'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-8938903260660891905</id><published>2023-07-01T04:30:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2023-07-01T04:30:17.862-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Wealth-based affirmative action?</title><content type='html'>I can understand why many lefties are in a huff about affirmative action. Affirmative action policies are meant to be anti-racist, and maybe reverse residual effects of racist American policies of the past and general prejudice of society at large. Plus, universities like having multicolored recruitment posters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However even with affirmative action, elite universities have a horrid track record of admitting marginalized students. Here's data from my old economics professor Danny Yagan and others about how elite universities by-and-large take in students with very high-income families and spit them out into the high-income labor market. Stories of a low-class student of color's life being changed through education are statistically, few and far between.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Family wealth and income, to me, is what really matters in terms of education and inequality. Race is tied to it, but not the only thing that divides the have and the have-nots. So although Clarence Thomas and his posy in the Supreme Court have struck down race-based affirmative action, aren't there other still-legal policies that can amend American inequality? I'm curious if so, and if not, why not.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/8938903260660891905/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/07/wealth-based-affirmative-action.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/8938903260660891905'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/8938903260660891905'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/07/wealth-based-affirmative-action.html' title='Wealth-based affirmative action?'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-377281732258542792</id><published>2023-06-27T01:29:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2023-06-27T01:29:06.212-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>纽约是不是世界最发达的城市？</title><content type='html'>I'm chatting with a couple Chinese folks at the hostel I'm staying at in Shanghai. Many people I speak to in China have a surprising reverence for America. I ask one of my roommates, "in America we have the American dream. Do you have the Chinese dream here in China?" He says that actually, I still want to go to America, that's where we all want to go. In Shanghai, Suzhou, and other prosperous cities in China, I'm told more and more young people are trying to move abroad to study. "But," my hostel-mate caveats, "is it true that you have many guns in America?"&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm talking with a girl from Shenzhen and the hostel receptionist one evening. The girl from Shenzhen asks, "is it true New York is the world's most developed city?" I'm not a New Yorker but I'm more than happy to shit on it. I tell them the New York subway is dirty, the trains aren't on time, many people live without a home, and a million people died in America from COVID. The receptionist nods solemnly, and says, "maybe it has to do with politics." The Shenzhener says, "maybe we all see the darkness in the places we are from."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's also true that we see light in places we are not from -- oh, how public transport advocates envy China's brilliant, world-class high-speed rail network.

He walks into a Jamba Juice and says "hey, how are you!" Not to a friend but to a complete stranger who is behind the cash register. Dean is vegan like me and likes that Jamba Juice has added Impossible Burger to their menu. He says so to the cashier, who I imagine is a hippie-ish dude with long curly hair and tattoos on his arms but not his legs, even though it has no relevance to his order. Dean proceeds to order something with granola in it, but, like me, he wants to know if the granola is made with honey. The cashier says it's a good question and he'll have to get back to Dean about that even though if it really is such a good question, why hasn't he himself before today? The cashier goes to the back to check. Meanwhile a lady comes up to Dean and asks, "are you in line or have you paid?" Dean stumbles a little because the truthful answer is that he's waiting on the cashier to look up whether the granola has traces of honey which is made from bees which suffer kind of at the merciless hands of humans but actually mostly from neglect during transfer of these insects in the honey-production process and so that means Dean is not in line but he also hasn't paid so Dean doesn't finish his sentence. "Nope, yeah, no honey. You're all good," says the cashier when he's back. "Great, I'll have that then. That's Dean.

My gracious father (happy Father's Day!) accompanied me on a few Saturdays to these rather quiet, solemn affairs. Kids of various ages would whip each other's asses on viscious terrain while the parents would sit in the break room and drink coffee. My opponents in chess where always more serious than I was, and normally better. They would write down every move in a booklet so they could play back the game later. I would play from the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walked in the room with my devoted team of supporters -- Etienne, 
Leon, Penny, and Gary -- to a room of kids. Ranging from six to ten years old, most smaller the ones I teach at cram school. I'd call them all &lt;i&gt;meimei &lt;/i&gt;(little sister) or &lt;i&gt;didi &lt;/i&gt;(little brother) because, well, they were all that small. I was welcomed to the registration table, however, and was grateful to see a couple people above the age of fifteen (by far the minority).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next two and a half hours I proceeded to get my ass whooped. My first loss was against a small boy (age 7-ish) in yellow -- I'll call him Tomahawk, named after his viscous side-spin serve. Every ball he served whipped to the left, and I felt woefully unprepared. After one game (best of five), we broke and the boy got water from his parents. I went to my friend and ping pong partner Etienne. He said, "Rohan, I've played against a guy like this before. You can't take his bait, you have to counter-act his serve. You need to go right to go left." With a room full of children, their parents, and flying balls I couldn't exactly master the Tomahawk serve response, and soon enough lost three consecutive games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second up was another kid, slighter bigger in blue. I called him Puma because that was the brand of his shirt but he sure acted like one, too. Puma played hard and fast, taking every forehand as the opportunity to strike. I felt I had a fighting chance against Puma because unlike Tomahawk, his serve was normal. But Puma beat me fair and square. Even more frightening, though, was his stance and poker face. Win or lose, Puma showed no emotions. After winning the first game his dad urgently hit him on the forehead and seemed to imply how Puma should be doing better than this. Etienne commented, "it's sad, man, never feeling like you're doing enough. That kids going to end up with some kind of inferiority complex." I nodded, feeling like playing little kids is a little bit of a lose-lose situation, but forged one (and proceeded to get whooped two more games). To his credit, Puma shook my hand after the game and walked away with little joy on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My final match was with the oldest opponent I had played that day (he looked to be fourteen or slightly older). &lt;i&gt;Jiayou&lt;/i&gt;, I shouted ("good luck!"), and he smiled back. I won one game this time and danced in a circle! My friends cheered, knowing that was my goal for my first tournament. The Teenager played well, but not perfectly, which made it a good match. He won 3-1 and thereby qualified for the final elimination tournament (I didn't).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left after that, happy to leave the pressure-cooker environment. I reflected that one-on-one competition is no easy thing. The other sports like that -- ping pong/tennis, chess/go, martial arts -- all take a form of seriousness at the professional level. You are left on your own to savor victories and accept defeat. There's no element of chance. Just you and your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the floor upstairs, my friends I watched the advanced tournament going on simultaneously. Mostly still young kids, maybe averaging a couple years older. One boy holds back tears as he plays. He raises his left hand to signal to his opponent that he's not yet ready to start, sniffles, and presses on. On a different table, a girl is locked in an epic duel with a boy that obnoxiously shouts &lt;i&gt;"DUI!"&lt;/i&gt; every time he scores a point. She develops her own call, &lt;i&gt;"Wei!"&lt;/i&gt;. But eventually she suffers a defeat, three to one, like my match against the Teenager. She's only eight-years-old, I learn from her father; dexterity ten times greater than my students at school. &lt;i&gt;"Ni hen lihai,"&lt;/i&gt; I say (you're really good). She smiles at me. After a day of losing I reflect that the hardest part about sports is learning how to lose even when you give it your all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/7280495538859821817/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/06/ping-pong-competition-1.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7280495538859821817'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7280495538859821817'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/06/ping-pong-competition-1.html' title='Ping Pong Competition 1'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-7235964468274122419</id><published>2023-06-19T03:16:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2023-06-19T03:16:38.039-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Aoyan's Pipa</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I met a man named Aoyan today playing the &lt;i&gt;pipa&lt;/i&gt;, a Chinese instrument. It's like a guitar, but has a bustier bottom, and has a fabulous sound -- the sound of rain drops and a mountain-side view. It reminds me of those old Chinese landscape paintings, the ones where there are people walking along a bridge carrying water for the village, and people dressed up riding horses and the mountains in the background. All from four strings and a block of wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aoyan tells me the &lt;i&gt;pipa's &lt;/i&gt;ancestor is the &lt;i&gt;lute&lt;/i&gt;. The design was passed Eastward and, according to Aoyan, is the origin of similar instruments like the Middle Eastern &lt;i&gt;oud &lt;/i&gt;and the Indian &lt;i&gt;sitar&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aoyan goes through a variety of techniques on the &lt;i&gt;pipa&lt;/i&gt;. The sound of raindrops, that's a technique. And so is the heavy vibrato that's as vibrant as an electric guitar. One can even cross strings on the &lt;i&gt;pipa&lt;/i&gt;, and when strum together it gives a terrific crash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;i&gt;pipa&lt;/i&gt; from the Qing and Ming dynasties have been preserved, Aoyan tells me. He saw some masters playing them at an academy in Taipei. But you can also buy them on &lt;i&gt;Taobao&lt;/i&gt; for a few hundreds US dollars. &lt;i&gt;You seem like you're interested in learning instruments&lt;/i&gt;, Aoyan says to me. It's true that I am. Having just started learning guitar, I'm realizing the vastness of what you can do with four metal strings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/7235964468274122419/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/06/aoyans-pipa.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7235964468274122419'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7235964468274122419'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/06/aoyans-pipa.html' title='Aoyan&apos;s Pipa'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-8435154555022737544</id><published>2023-05-26T19:01:00.006-07:00</published><updated>2023-05-26T19:22:22.511-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>不對！</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;I flick my wrist and strike the ball with a satisfying &lt;i&gt;tut&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Score,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;I think, but &lt;i&gt;jìaolìan, &lt;/i&gt;my coach, doesn't agree. &lt;i&gt;Búdùi&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;he says. Wrong. He shows me the stroke one more time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just about everything in ping pong can be put into the &lt;i&gt;duì&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(correct) or búdùi (incorrect) classification. My coach is a math teacher at a &lt;i&gt;bǔxíbān&lt;/i&gt;, a cram school, which maybe means he's especially familiar with what's wrong and right. My footwork is &lt;i&gt;búdùi&lt;/i&gt; (if you're moving right, you should move the left foot first). My posture is &lt;i&gt;búdùi&lt;/i&gt;, I'm standing too upright. My hand grips the racket completely&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;búdùi&lt;/i&gt;-ly. "The fundamentals of ping pong are very important," my coach unhelpfully adds, and he sends another ball my way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are moments, precious few, when I hit the ball in a non-objectible manner. "OK," he says. &lt;i&gt;OK &lt;/i&gt;is a special loan-word in Taiwanese Mandarin -- in American English it might translate as, "well done!" or "fantastic!!" or "you're a star student!!!" In Chinese, they don't waste the breath.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My coach hits the ball back with startling precision. I put all the force I can muster on some of the "OK" balls but my coach sweeps his hand back exactly right so I can do it all again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In my fourth group lesson I notice my coach playing with his left hand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Coach, you're not a leftie, are you??"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I can do both," he says nonchalantly. He explains later, "I'm right-handed, but I realized my form on my right-hand was often &lt;i&gt;búdùi&lt;/i&gt;, so I trained with my coach on the left," like what he did was the most sensical thing in the world.

My predessor Bryan found him impossible. Bryan had him through the COVID online teaching period and eventually found a way to have him sent down a few English "levels", which is how he ended up in my class. Hank was dumped into my class.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hank's offenses are sometimes minor. But over time they accumulate, and taking away "stars", a little school reward system, doesn't do quite enough. So inspired by my boss I thought that if students do something pretty bad twice, they just stay after class and write lines.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I held him after class the first time a couple months into teaching. "I will not throw balls at my classmates." He writes it ten times and we read it together, ten times. "Got it, Hank?" He goes on his way home. Then, just a couple weeks later, he suddenly was yelling swear words at someone for losing at Foosball. I held him back again: "I will not shout in class." Twenty times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once Hank had an intense argument with a boy named Tom over the ownership of a pen cap. They used all their English possible to argue and I sent them downstairs to my manager. "It was the stupidest argument," she told me later. "Hank doesn't even have that type of pen."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hank finds behavior normal that other kids would never consider. I'll look away for five seconds and Hank will have tackled Eason and they'll be wrestling on the ground. Hank stays after class.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Why were you wrestling Eason?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Eason and I are friends, Teacher! I thought it was fun play."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I will not wrestle my friends." Thirty times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm not an ardent disciplinarian. Honestly, I was never made to write lines in school. Part of me detests this inane punishment that seems like it's out of Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts. But I also like that I have some distance from the punishment. Hank can break the rules and be penalized for it, but that doesn't mean he's a bad kid. He's like many other kids, just a touch on the hyper-active side. No, I've never been angry at him, even when he gets two strikes in the first five minutes of class -- just maybe exasperated. Some times I've held him back have actually been rather nice bonding moments. "So, you know why you're here..." Other times he's left the room crying, and I wonder if I've gotten carried away in my pursuit of justice. But over time, our synergy has improved... Such that he mostly stays within the bounds of reason, even if he's slamming his whole body again them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today I met Hank's father. He's a well-built man; big like Hank; his right hand is missing half his pinky. He lives in Chengdu, Sichuan, China and comes back to Kaohsiung every three months or so. This time he stopped by his son's &lt;i&gt;buxiban&lt;/i&gt;, worried about his grades are in decline.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I shake Hank's dad's hand, honored to meet the man himself. In Chinese I say, Hank does fine on tests. He's sometimes loud, and he sometimes gets in fights. And he talks kind of funny. But you know sir, Hank's an alright kid.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/2099285139731092176/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/05/hank-and-goliath.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/2099285139731092176'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/2099285139731092176'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/05/hank-and-goliath.html' title='Hank and Goliath '/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-5092006533053890761</id><published>2023-05-24T10:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2023-05-24T10:37:01.388-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Veganizing</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;When I first turned vegan I was 18.

She feinted in the middle of the night some years ago. Since then she's been watching her stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My other co-worker has heart problems. Something about inconsistent beating. One doctor said he had a stroke. Another doctor said it's fine. Eventually they put some radioactive substance in his blood to track the flow of it, or something, and after this test they said it was all fine for real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One was a man I play badminton with in Weiwuying Park. He's an 
excellent player and gracious, too. He's ever-welcoming, easy to chat 
to, and invites any and all to join the game. Anyways, I was asking him 
what he gets up to at home once he's done with badminton. He said he 
eats dinner with his family, then goes for a walk. The doctor says it's 
not good to sit around right after a big dinner. And moreover, he 
recently started taking small insulin tablets. One a day, which is not 
much, but to him, it's permanent. Diabetes is no small thing, and once 
you start on those pills, he said, you can't go back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My other co-worker (last one) always has back pain issues. Sometimes I've been asked to sub for her for it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These instances come up now and again. When I was younger, hearing these stories would bore me because, well, I'm far away from that point in life. But these days, I teach across the hall from these people, or play badminton on the other side of the court from them. And moreover, I'll turn forty some day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health is one of those things that worries everyone, no matter your age. I think at forty, maybe work and marriage and groceries have more or less been worked out. But not the changes to your body. Not especially natural deterioration, which happens over the course of several decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My instinct is to say, I'll stay healthy, watch my sugar levels, regularly exercise, etc. But that truthfully only staves off reality. I'll have health issues at some point in my life (in fact, I already have had injuries from biking without handlebars and things like that). When I turn forty, I hope I'll be able to accept that these things are basically inevitable*.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;* unless there's &lt;a href="https://www.sens.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;anti-aging remedies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading" target="_blank"&gt;uploaded consciousness&lt;/a&gt; by then, which is possible but I'm not holding my breath.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/6362868824878715587/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/05/turning-forty.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/6362868824878715587'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/6362868824878715587'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/05/turning-forty.html' title='Turning forty'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-947142040897303566</id><published>2023-05-22T02:32:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2023-05-22T02:32:36.561-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Sitting at Sunny Day Coffee Roasters</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;and free writing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I went to the tax office to try to get a tax rebate.

The good news is that I don't have to worry about taxes, the bad news is I don't get any money from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July my college friend, roommate, and co-worker Leon is moving back to the US. He is a dual-US/Taiwanese citizen and for some reason, doesn't want to serve in the Taiwanese military. He says that he doesn't want to perish in cross-strait warfare. I told him Xi Jinping says the People's Liberation Army won't be ready until 2027, but nonetheless, here we are. Honestly speaking, though, I wouldn't want to necessarily do something (the military) for four months either. Jobs aren't as highly-paid in Taiwan as they are in the US, not by a long-shot. Most people who have the option of both choose to live in the US and make an American salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, my roommate leaving felt like a big change. I'm scared of living alone and being lonely, so I found a shared apartment. Four bedrooms, myself and three strangers. I loosely know the landlord, so I think they won't be crazy. In Taiwan, I think people are much more likely to be quiet, get on with their business, and never interact with flatmate than be overly combative. I'm nervous about moving in with strangers, as I've never done it before, and I'm also nervous about conducting all household business in Chinese. But on the other hand, it's a natural step up in my immersion setting. I'm confident in my Mandarin right now, but for the most part I choose when to deploy it and when not to. Now I'll have to have Chinese on my brain whenever I'm home, managing things in the house, etc. I think it'll be a growth experience. And not so awful, since many of my friendships in Taiwan are at least half in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend Ella told me a bit of advice she heard: "life is long enough to do everything you want to do." Is this true? I suppose it depends how many things you want to do. I think maybe most people get to what they want in life not because of a lack of time. More because of priorities. Their twenties were spent doing a job they had to do, or just chose but didn't like; then in their thirties they got sucked into a career or a marriage and these responsibilities just accelerate. A recurring bit of wisdom I've heard is to go on adventures while you can. My colleagues, who are around forty, and my old math teacher (about 60), both essentially said, you're hardly ever too young to start over. Anyways, this is all to say that I'm still in Taiwan because I feel like I'm learning here. I'm learning how to live in a new place, how to manage relationships as an adult, how to manage money, how to speak another language, how to make choices. Taiwan makes this easier in some ways, with most things being absurdly affordable and convenient. Though living in a new place, speaking in a second language, also makes things novel and rewarding and challenging in their own way. It's such that when/if I return to the US, hopefully everything will be easy-mode... making friends, doing adult things. Easy to the point of monotony? I can't be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since coming to Taiwan, my goals have somewhat pivoted. Regarding language, I came here intent on going from my foundation in Chinese to a strong speaking level. Now, I feel like I've more or less achieved that -- confident enough to do most every daily task in Chinese, and have rich conversations (with somewhat simplified language). I don't say I'm fluent at Chinese because there's many things I can't do (as with anything). But then, I can say I'm proficient -- more proficient than many Americans get with a second language. I also had the less well-defined goal of enjoying life and exploring new places. I've been doing so to a large extent. Enjoying life out of college has been different than I expected. Though I have ample free time at first I didn't have tons to do each day, and so I felt at a loss. Now I feel like my life is more full, even overly-busy at times, but still enjoyable. Living in a place I think necessitates sacrificing freedom for consistency... that is, consistently attending flute classes on Mondays, for example, means that I can't go on long weekend trips out of town. But then, I'm discovering that I enjoy a fulfilling routine more than the barrage of decisions necessitated by travelling. The exploration part of life, I think, is not so much my goal as learning what really fulfills me in a week -- playing music, reading, interacting with my students, learning things, journalling and reflecting. I've realized that more hobbies than I thought transfer to wherever I live, Taiwan or otherwise. If I ever move to a new place again, I'd like to say I'll be even more prepared, and more commited to the routines that ground my life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I've also been learning how to accept things out of my control. For instance, I think there's a chance that super-smart artificial intelligence will take over the world in a couple decades. But what can I do about that? Right now, rather little. The same goes with traffic jams, train delays, scheduling conflicts, and whether my clothes will crease from being left in the laundry too long. Rationally speaking, once you commit to a decision, there's no point worrying about counter-factuals until you come to the next decision-point. Easier said than done. Post-college life goes at a slower pace. There's more value to being content in the present, leveling up as you can in day-to-day life rather than considering things existentially. That's what my blog's for after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/947142040897303566/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/05/sitting-at-sunny-day-coffee-roasters.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/947142040897303566'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/947142040897303566'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/05/sitting-at-sunny-day-coffee-roasters.html' title='Sitting at Sunny Day Coffee Roasters'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-5724019452297221562</id><published>2023-05-22T01:24:00.006-07:00</published><updated>2023-05-22T01:27:20.806-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Toilet cloggage in on the Taiwan Railway</title><content type='html'>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38;

I'd struggle to hold back a smirk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home? The US was the place I was born, but the UK was the place where I grew up. I had no memory of the US, a land foreign to me. Big roads, big brands, big people. Cars on the wrong side of the road. Entrance to the country was followed by a painful hour at a car rental place. That was America -- a place for summer trips and family friends I didn't know. A vestige of my family's life before I knew how to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet my documents recognized my place of birth -- Livingstone, New Jersey -- and so I was welcomed home. They call border control "the first line of defense". They play a video narrated by the American president: George W. Bush, then Barack Obama, then Donald Trump when I moved for college. In London, I observed America from a distance -- through British news 
coverage, long-distance phone calls and five to eight hours of time 
difference. The country I was born in was changing all without me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This July may be the first time I really feel what it's like to "go back to the states." My identity of Americanness has developed, calloused as I've lived here. When people have asked me where I'm from, I defer to where I lived last, which was Berkeley, California. In Chinese, the "beautiful country". The process of saying this again and again makes me think, "hey, maybe I am American." Being American -- and of an Indian-background -- is what uniquely identifies me in Taiwan. It's what makes me an English-speaker, and lets me have my job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young, pre-pubescent Rohan might wonder why I enjoy a visit "home". To me now, I reluctantly accept that with my cultural backgronud, America is the place to go back to.

There are those living normal lives like you or I: walking on two legs in the bright, open sunshine. And there are those living underground, the shadow people. Life below is a sorry imitation of life above the shadows. The shadow children get partially chewed dolls for Christmas; the people walk with a strange limp and speak raspily. The worlds are separate until they aren't -- until the moment they collide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was last October that I lost my phone in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. I was biking to the pool and had my phone in my swimming trunks. It must have slipped out on the street because when I was out of the water, ready to change and head phone, I felt an empty feeling in my left pocket. I tried calling the police, and calling the phone, and going back through the streets to search, but eventually I came to acceptance. It was an old phone and I had backed up practically everything important last summer before I moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's March now and I was more than a little shocked when the ghost of my phone came to haunt my five months after the fact. My Facebook account had been hacked. An IP based in Iwaya, Nigeria had changed the password to my account... using my old phone number, which was supposedly deactivated some time ago. By the time I was aware of the issue, the hacker had changed everything -- my recovery number, email, and 2-step authentification so it was impossible to get into my account. I felt like I was facing this person in Facebook court: they had custody of my account and all the information, while I had my name, ID, and charming good lucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our phones, I've noticed before, make us cyborgs in our 21st century reality. We're glued to them at every moment -- on the subway, in line for vegetable dumplings, at work under the desk. It's our nexus to our friends and family of past and present. To stroves of information and any song you can think of. But by nature of being so close to us, it's also a vulnerability. When your phone is hacked or an account is breached that has tangible power over your life, personal and financial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was lamenting my loss of Facebook access to my roommate. He told me he had been scammed before by someone posing as his then-landlord. They asked for $200 via. Apple gift-card and my roommate obliged, thinking he was doing a favor and would get paid back. When it turned out it was all a scam, he wallowed for days, thinking about how silly it was to lose so much money for a stupid trick, and how awful this person probably in Nigeria was for stealing his money. Then he thought that the person might not be from Nigeria and in fact thinking so might be a little racist. I've thought similarly when my bike -- admittedly locked flimsily -- was stolen in London. This is how the shadow people -- whoever and wherever they are -- make a living. At least my shadow person may plausibly be from Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle for my Facebook account continues. My and my shadowy self wrestle back and forth on Facebook's invisible servers, our attentions online but our physical selves perhaps separated by continents. I frantically close all the portals to my life that my phone may key into, whilst my hacker posts photos of phallus-looking sweet potatos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/7041339864283499078/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/03/the-battle-for-myself.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7041339864283499078'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7041339864283499078'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/03/the-battle-for-myself.html' title='The battle for myself'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-9204850027227773710</id><published>2023-03-06T06:33:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2023-03-06T06:33:12.444-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Movie shooting Day 1</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-language: ZH-TW;"&gt;Today I had a terrific day shooting a movie! I got up bright and early
and basically made it on time to Gangshan, the south-most station. I met two
other foreigners there – we had arranged to ride a taxi together to the
shooting site, which was a ways a way. We waited for another dude, from
Morroco, but he ended up already being there so we just went. The other guys had
been to previous days of filming, but this was also their first movie. They
said previously, the filmmakers had them soaking past midnight, drenched under
a rain machine in loose-fitting clothing. Tough life, I guess. One of them, a guy
from Belgium, had just finished a year on a student visa in Taiwan. He wants to
stay longer, but hasn’t found a good way to. But since Peter – our agent, I suppose
– kept badgering him to show up to the filming (virtually), he went to Vietnam,
got a tourist visa and re-entered Taiwan for these days of filming. It only hit
him after filming how background the foreigners really are.&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-language: ZH-TW;"&gt;There were two “agents” kind of in-charge of us foreigners. One guy
basically just met us, took attendance, hung around all day and then paid us in
cash before we left. Another woman named Michelle was more responsible for
dragging us around, making sure our bathroom breaks were quick, and that we
returned the costumes and such. She was one of those brisk Taiwanese people –
especially speaking in English, but I think Mandarin, too – and often snappish.
I talked to her more casually before and after we left the actual scene,
though, and I’m not so convinced she loves the film industry, or speaking
English, or a combination of the two, but it’s more a job that she happened to
land.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-language: ZH-TW;"&gt;At any rate, I learned soon into starting filming more about the film’s
location. It’s set in Japanese-occupied Malaysia, 1945. Palawa, I think. The
main character is a Taiwanese administrator sent to govern the colonies. The
prisoners of war – ie. me and the other foreigners – are presumably captured
British and Americans (of various ethnicities) working under Japanese rule. I
don’t know much more than that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-language: ZH-TW;"&gt;The first shot of the day involved a CGI elephant. It was really a big
car covered in a blue screen pulling an artificial boulder along. One of the
Japanese soldiers whipped it several times until the producer (?) says &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="ZH-CN" style="font-family: SimSun; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ascii-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;"&gt;大象倒！&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast;"&gt;and everyone stops and stares. The rest of the scenes today were shot at
the same location. It turns out that the elephant dies, and some of the other
foreign prisoners of war start pulling the artificial boulder. Then, the
artificial boulder runs over the hand of the main character – the Taiwenese guy
– and breaks it, leading to an emergency situation. And that’s the extent of
what I know of the plot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast;"&gt;The
movie was really quite cliquish, and I enjoyed looking around the scene and
chatting to different people. At the start, I saw a middle-aged man who looked
chill enough wearing sweatpants, and as I was getting my turban put on, I said,
“hey what’s your name?” in Chinese. He said, &lt;i&gt;laoban. &lt;/i&gt;I laughed – the boss.
I suppose he really was The Boss, responsible for getting investments for the
film. And I suppose extra characters don’t often talk to the &lt;i&gt;laoban&lt;/i&gt;. But
he humored me, I guess curious enough about what an Indian looking American-accenting
&lt;i&gt;Guoyu-&lt;/i&gt;speaking extra was doing in Southern Taiwan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast;"&gt;The Boss
and the Director &lt;i&gt;(daoyuan)&lt;/i&gt; go by their titles, like I do at &lt;i&gt;buxiban&lt;/i&gt;.
The director stayed in the director’s tent a lot of the time, where he had a
view of each scene as they were shot by the cameras. He would call &lt;i&gt;cut &lt;/i&gt;when
the course of a shot was done, and would decide whether a shot would be done again.
He spoke through a walkie talkie to a man I’ll call the Producer. The Producer
spoke to the Taiwanese actors, and to the women who spoke English, who then
spoke to us. The Boss and the Director were, by the nature of their title, put
on a pedestal, and certainly above us puny extra actors. Yet still, when they
tried to speak English I internally scoffed, and thought how my nine-year-olds at
Schoolhouse would whip them in an English contest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast;"&gt;There were
countless others on set. The costume ladies, who put on our make-up and seemed
ever amazed at how fast the water they sprayed on the actors – fake sweat –
dried in the sun. The camera dudes, with their large tripods and cameras and boba
tea. The sound folk, who had a muted and unmuted recorder. Then many other
people – agents, the mom of a kid, assistants and I’m not sure who else – who didn’t
have an obvious job related to the filming of the movie but more to do with
organization and getting things for people who were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast;"&gt;I talked
about half and half with the foreign prisoners of war and our captors, the Japanese
soldiers. The Japanese soldiers were of course Taiwanese dudes. Mostly in their
late twenties, they had been in many plays before and studied theater in university.
They live as freelancers, and two of them told me they found the gig just on Facebook.
(The one exception was a guy was playing the Japanese general, who was actually
Japanese, but spoke excellent Mandarin, indistinguishable to me from a Taiwanese
person).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast;"&gt;The
Japanese soldiers were incredibly fun to talk to. I had a real moment in the
morning with one who used to work at a jazz bar. He said (in Chinese), “you heard
about the Wynton Marselis concert?” Yes, and we both said at the same time, “in
Weiwuying. Yes. Are you going? No, not this time.” We laughed at that as the Producer
shouted “stand-by” and “action” and I started putting rocks in a basket again. Anyways,
this guy is a real jazz appreciator; when he worked at the jazz bar, Marselis
(in Kaohsiung) he would see high-quality live concerts all the time. Before he
started politics and policy at university. He studied rhetoric and did his
Master’s thesis about Trump’s speeches and how they appeal to crowds. Most of
his classmates went on to become speech writers, but he made a turn into
bartending and now movies/theater. Another guy, Little Shen, reads philosophy
books in his spare time. He happened to also be headed back to the Cultural Center,
so we got dinner and it turned out he is also vegetarian! Amazing. His
girlfriend lives in Taipei and works at a company that makes Indian clothes for
Taiwanese consumers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast;"&gt;I was
incredibly enthusiastic at the beginning of filming, and my smile showed it.
Almost excessive, but I unashamedly looked at every detail of the filming. The
blue screen, the screens the Director would see, the way that they lit fire in
front of the camera to emulate heat waves. I made jokes to everyone I could and
soaked up the compliments on my Mandarin, which was the best of the foreigners
(I was asked to translate at one point, but then they stopped, and instead just
addressed me in Mandarin by my Chinese name &lt;i&gt;Tianlan&lt;/i&gt;). I enjoyed a truly
immersive experience, and I enjoyed being able to interface with the Taiwanese
staff members of all types in a way the other &lt;i&gt;waiguoren &lt;/i&gt;couldn’t. As the
day wore on, I grew weary, and I began to understand the fatigue that most
others had been experiencing for a couple weeks now. The filming starts early,
goes consistently for 10-12 hours, and requires a lot of patience to get each
shot right. The actors have to dress up in make-up each time and everyone has
to be high-alert on the lookout for anything that looks out of place or inconsistent,
at times very late into the night, and if something has to be done over, it
would be very costly. Connections are fleeting on set – many different
companies or freelancers are involved and there isn’t much team-bonding. It’s
mostly people doing what they’re told to do, or people telling other people
what to do. When everyone’s done with this gig, they find something/someone
else to work for and don’t think about it much ever again. I was ready to go
home at sunset, but like everyone else stayed until we finished the final shot.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast;"&gt;Yet I
find great comradery among the actors, and I admire the Taiwanese soldier guys
for the work they put into acting. My new friend Woody (&lt;i&gt;hudi)&lt;/i&gt; said he doesn’t
get so dejected by not making an audition anymore. He’s done it many, many
times. No, if he thinks his performance was bad, he’ll just go outside, smoke a
cigarette, and move on to the next one. There’s a practically – and a devotion
to his craft – that I admire immensely, and I said as much on the car-ride back.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is the second installment of my biannual life update to friends and family. Keeping in touch is a two-way street, so please do feel free to share your updates -- long or short -- back my way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this issue I've writing about teaching English, Chinese language study, and adulting in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be well all... and happy Year of the Rabbit!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teaching English&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, I've been teaching for over five months now. For many hours in a day, I'm the de facto adult in the room: the enforcer of rules, the master of ceremonies, the entertainer. Being a student is far easier -- you just listen to someone talk, take notes or do worksheets. But teaching kids I hardly ever have a moment's rest. I must my eyes on the kids around the room whilst ideating our next activity whilst teaching why Sam-I-am does not want green eggs and ham. Do the kids want "duck, duck, goose" or "the jumping game" next?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some memorable moments have been telling a boy off for writing "f*#$" on the whiteboard, asking young Anne how she wanted to deal with her tooth that fell out during class, and scaring a first grader with my (I guess) creepy clown costume. It's at these times that I think -- wow, I really am an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students themselves are wonderful. They're inventive, 
hard-working, playful, fun. We operate in a "language-immersion" setting
 which means that they're only allowed to speak English (otherwise we do
 terrible things like take away stars or hold them after class). And 
even with their understandably limited vocabularies, I feel their 
personalities in full force. Each class is complete with its own class clowns, trouble-makers and do-gooders. I see myself in the kids -- the quiet boy doing his homework early or the chatty bunch all feels like me at different ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've learned a great deal about English itself. Why is it that "she teaches" but "I teach" but "we both taught"? When do you say "I saw that movie" vs "I have seen that movie"? And did you know you can &lt;i&gt;invent &lt;/i&gt;an &lt;i&gt;invention &lt;/i&gt;but you can't &lt;i&gt;solute &lt;/i&gt;a &lt;i&gt;solution&lt;/i&gt;? English is a wild thing, especially for 7-13 year-olds. And it's wildly different from Chinese, a language entirely without articles, past/future tense and even an alphabet. I'm slowly learning to find order in the chaos, and ways to present it all best to second language learners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching is a challenge, no doubt. But it makes me think and keeps me motivated and feels like something worth getting out of bed for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;related blogpost &lt;a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/one-month-later-in-taiwan.html"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chinese&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being in Taiwan is of course a way for me to be immersed in Mandarin, the official language of the island (they also speak &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien"&gt;Taiwanese Hokkien&lt;/a&gt;, though not often in official contexts; and there's Hakka and a number of indigenous languages). I was thrilled when I arrived to find out that my Chinese is better than most people's English. That's been helpful, because though people like to practice their English and know a fair few words, they have little practice stringing together sentences and navigating the relatively complex subject of English grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is to say I've gotten my fair share of Chinese practice. At times too much. When I first got here it hit me how much I don't know in Chinese. My 7 years of study in middle/high school felt like it got me nowhere except "Hello. I am American. What is your favorite color?". Conversations deviate rather quickly from that. My roommate Leon has had an excellent ear for Mandarin from the start -- his parents are Taiwanese -- and so I've often envied his ways of grasping the gist of a conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things have improved. I've been intentional about my study -- much moreso than I was in school
 -- and had plenty of places to learn new words and their applications. So after these six months, I feel confident taking phone calls, communicating via. text; and doing things like buying a new phone and or going to a Chinese-only speaking dentist (we made it work). I went to a co-worker's New Year's party and learned about my colleague's friend who's done ship maintenance in the Falkland Islands (in Chinese). It's the little things that make me feel the 成就感 (sense of accomplishment). It's quite the feeling to successfully fire off horrid dad jokes or make small talk -- it tells me I'm getting somewhere. Of course many topics continue to elude my grasp. You'd find my thoughts on Korean dramas and mattress firmness rather lacking, to name a couple examples. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language learning continues to be extremely fascinating. On the one hand, it seems to get harder and harder the more I do it (as I &lt;a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/01/swimming-with-fishes-or-my-english-is.html" target="_blank"&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; recently); but it also grows increasingly intoxicating. I feel closer day-by-day to understanding current events and the political climate in the Chinese-speaking world. Fascinating, to say the least, and markedly differnent from the struggles in Western politics. To some extent I believe in that old cliche quote, "to speak another language is to possess another soul."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;related blogpost &lt;a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/11/language-learning-just-two-cents.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/01/swimming-with-fishes-or-my-english-is.html"&gt;one linked above&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adulting in Taiwan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being in Taiwan has also been my first time "adulting" in full force. I mean adulting in the way of having a real job, a paycheck every two weeks, bills and rent to pay, money to manage... the whole nine yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most relevant is perhaps the fact of not being in a university environment. College friends and social circles are ready-made through classes, clubs and the campus space. But in Kaohsiung, a city of 3 million people, community must be intentionally sought after. In Chinese, they have a handy word 約 (yuē) which means to arrange time with someone. 約 maybe has become my middle-name, in that I do it as often as I can. But I think that's the kind of proactivity that it takes to be social out in the real world. I've done my best to find my people. I do language exchange with two friends every Friday night; I play badminton with a group of people (who I just walked up to in a park) near work; I take a flute class at a Buddhist temple with a bunch of middle-aged ladies. And there's people I've met at restaurants or through animal rights activism who've turned into good friends. I feel grateful for the people I've met, but there are times I feel lonely, maybe just by nature of being so far from my family and home of four years. I think that's part of adulting, as well -- to be comfortable in your own skin. I'm ever grateful for my buddy Leon, who came from Berkeley with me to teach and learn Chinese as well. Having a friend, roommate, and companion for this life transition has been really invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've felt light on responsibility here, and in many ways that feels weird. In university it felt like there was so much I could and had to be doing at every moment. But in the work-force (if you can call teaching kids "the work-force"), I come home from class and basically have complete freedom over what I want to do. I've read a couple novels; sometimes I read books about Taiwanese/Chinese history and politics; I listen to Mandarin podcasts and endlessly review flashcards; I've gone biking late out on the city streets. Being free and financially independent is quite a trip. Did you know I could buy boba tea every day, and sometimes do? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there's Kaohsiung as a city. People say that Taiwan is the heart of Asia, because people are so damn nice here. It's true. And it's especially true in the South. People are always open to talking to strangers, helping you on the street, or cutting you a discount on boba tea if you're missing a quarter. Kaohsiung's lacking in touristy stuff -- in fact, if you came my best recommendation might be the public library. But to me, what feels more important is the day-to-day. In my own way, I feel myself becoming a Kaohsiung-er... learning the names of Kaohsiung's streets, relaxingly into my morning cup of tea, and gifting guava to friends (the Taiwanese don't hug, but they have other ways of saying 我愛你). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people ask, both here and in the states, how long I'll stay in Taiwan, and what I plan to do next. I normally reply by flexing one of the two Chinese proverbs I know:且看且走 (to see as you walk) or 順其自然 (to let nature take its course). In English, I think that means I'll stay until something else calls out to me, or until I feel I'm no longer living life to its fullest. Which basically means, I don't know, and that's part of the fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/3471173932137011773/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/01/2023-01-semiannual-update.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3471173932137011773'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3471173932137011773'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/01/2023-01-semiannual-update.html' title='2023-01 Semiannual Update'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-4716019986272721245</id><published>2023-01-12T05:52:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2023-01-12T05:52:22.495-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>"Swimming with the fishes" or "My English is really good"</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;How good is my English? Really, quite good. In fact, yours is too, if you can understand every word I've used in my blog. I'm beginning to understand that being fluent in a language is no easy task. It took me two decades to get to my level with a sponge-like, child's brain and a fully immersive English environment. And not to brag, but I was speaking rather fluent English by maybe age 6. From then on, my diction and sophistication has only grown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a flex -- but this is the case for I believe about half a billion people in the world. And for the remaining several billion, another language serves as their "mother tongue". For the second language learner, though, learning English is a monumental task. One that even after a whole lifetime could be said to be incomplete. The second language learner doesn't have the same intuitive grasp of diction, rhythm, or pronunciation that the native speaker is blessed with from a young age. Perhaps if they are lucky, they live in a country where English is spoken, and from can catch the thrown-about phrases from people on the streets. Yet that doesn't mean you'll easily learn the English used in novels, policy memos, or political manifestos -- that work has to be done day-by-day for years on end. Learning a language is like trying to swim among the fishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some days it seems that learning Chinese becomes harder and harder the more I do it. Imagine a slowly expanding ball of knowledge; in the beginning, it only contains a few polite phrases (你好, 謝謝, 我是美國人); but over time, it grows and grows, and so too does its surrounding area. After long enough, it encompasses all the "conversational topics" it could ever have imagined; but the conversations get longer and longer; and its aspirations grow and grow; and it realizes that topics like the geography of Taiwan's Jade Mountain and the pros and cons of nuclear power require their own specific set of vocabulary and fluency; and the ball wonders if attaining such mass is ever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The de facto ideal for Chinese learners is set by reknown foreign "Sinologists". Also called "China experts", "China hands", or "China watchers", these are foreign professionals that have studied Chinese for many decades and made their careers out of mastering and utilizing their proficiency in the language. Take &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/owsRB4IKJyA"&gt;this clip&lt;/a&gt; of Perry Link (&lt;span lang="zh"&gt;林培瑞), &lt;/span&gt;a literature professor, comparing the Chinese administrations of Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong. To the untrained ear, it's impossible to tell that he's not a native Beijing-er (I include myself in this categorization). Yet a native Chinese speaker might tell you that his grammar has English influences, or that his "zh" or "ü" are not quite right. Another interesting example is Reverend László Ladányi, a Hungarian-born Jesuit priest (1914-1990). He specialized in interpreting the public statements of the Chinese Communist Party that was and are layeered in rich language, idioms and CCP-only allusions&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;László Ladányi was perhaps the only Westerner able to decipher such documents in the 1950s and 60s. Now, many more such burgeoning academics exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that each of these students of Chinese gave up a great deal to "master" the language. Language, like rocket science or brain surgery, is something anyone can do &lt;i&gt;if &lt;/i&gt;they dedicate themselves to it. The more pertinent question may be -- are you willing to do what it takes? It's rather like Wormtail cutting off his arm in Harry Potter, or Voldemort carving his soul into seven pieces...&amp;nbsp; Of course, learning Chinese is hardly a torturous process. Yet its opportunity costs are real, and it's benefits are uncertain; and certainly not as monetizable as a more practical language like C++ or Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't made any horcruxes. Nor have I sprouted any gils. But you can catch me out here in Kaohsiung City, swimming with the fishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="zh"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/4716019986272721245/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/01/swimming-with-fishes-or-my-english-is.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4716019986272721245'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4716019986272721245'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2023/01/swimming-with-fishes-or-my-english-is.html' title='&quot;Swimming with the fishes&quot; or &quot;My English is really good&quot;'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-5399560398151492897</id><published>2022-11-27T06:26:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2022-11-27T06:26:42.404-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Language Learning, just two cents</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Between teaching Chinese and learning, I've found myself spending a great deal of my waking hours thinking about language learning. It's not as overwhelming as it sounds. Language learning is rich and contains many elements. Right now, I have some sort of a system -- not so rigid and not so regimented, but a system nonetheless. So I figure I'd explain it in words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see learning languages as a layer of practices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practice 1: Vocabulary acquisition. Vocabulary is the first thing you can feasibly start with in any language, and in my eyes direct focus on vocabulary ought to continue as long as you can stand it. Even being in Taiwan, I don't feel I'm exposed to vocabulary (either in speech or writing) often enough to memorize it passively (nor is my memory that impressive). So I "go to the gym" for vocabulary. I try to do so every day using a program called Anki. Anki arranges flashcards so that you see words just when you're about to forget them. Forcing you to recall information at this point makes it create deeper connections in your brain. And hence, at a certain point the word will be in your long-term memory. I only add words I've heard used in conversation or seen in a reading somewhere so that I have some association with it (more association, the easier to memorize) and know how it's used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practice 2: Active reading/listening. There are many language learning podcasts for Mandarin Chinese that speak slower Mandarin (or mixed with English) and provide a transcript. Following along with both is great to create the audio-visual association (and it's strictly necessary for a non-phonetic language like Chinese). I also try to find readings at my skill-level (recently, the Chairman's Bao has been great for this) that also have audio recordings of their articles (or worst case, you can plug text you're reading into the audio function of Google translate). My kids at cram school also do this for all our readings. For them (and sometimes for me), it comes along with "shadow reading", which is repeating under your breath after a native speaker so that you get used to creating the sounds with your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practice 3: Grammar study. Textbooks, online resources, or a language teacher are essential for building grammar concepts. I've found that in Chinese, grammar is beautifully elegant (and simple) but still so radically different from English that it's hard to know how exactly to use (or when to apply certain concepts). So drilling grammar and then getting feedback on your writing from someone who knows what they're talking about is important. I imagine this is even more true for Romantic/Germanic/other languages where grammar is even more layered, inconsistent and messy... sometimes unintuitive sentences go into my Anki, because what you can't create from scratch sometimes has to just be rote memorize. It's in this part that a teacher is helpful for identifying your mistakes, or at least someone who's willing to give you feedback (on writing, for instance, since in writing you have time to be intentional about what words you use). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practice 4: Practice. I believe this is best done at your skill level, kind of like having a sparring partner. Or if you're like me and fortunate to live in the country whose language you are studying, "the streets" can serve as great conversation practice. It's also important to have deeper conversations with friends or a teacher about different topics, as much as you can. It's in these circumstances where I feel most lacking in my vocabulary, or my grammar feels overly simplistic, and I'm drawn back to practices 1-3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-light-theme" id="simple-translate"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-button isShow" style="background-image: url(&amp;quot;moz-extension://51173a79-5a5d-42fd-a1bd-54c53162968d/icons/512.png&amp;quot;); height: 22px; left: 563px; top: 455px; width: 22px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-panel " style="font-size: 13px; height: 200px; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-wrapper" style="overflow: hidden;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-move" draggable="true"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-contents"&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-result" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-candidate" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/5399560398151492897/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/11/language-learning-just-two-cents.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5399560398151492897'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5399560398151492897'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/11/language-learning-just-two-cents.html' title='Language Learning, just two cents'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-7017114661643213104</id><published>2022-11-18T21:01:00.003-08:00</published><updated>2022-12-05T02:47:07.257-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Prices in Taiwan</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Prices are interesting and sometimes hard to understand. In Taiwan, it feels like things are priced completely different to in the West and I'm trying to make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Category 1: Local goods and services. The cheapest things in Taiwan are the things I find myself buying most often. Rent; bubble tea, fruit juice; restaurant food; massages; tour guides; Chinese lessons. I think these things are cheap because they can't be sold abroad for a higher profit. The only demand is local Taiwanese people. Salaries here are (on average, I think) about a third of those in America (but since these important goods are also cheap, it means life is not so bad). My metric, which I think so far works, is to divide every price by 10. You see, there's 30 NTD to 1 USD. So if you divide the NTD price by 10 and then compare that price to what you'd pay in the USD (specifically, Berkeley/SF) then you can see what's reasonable and what's ripping you off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Category 2: Rich people's local goods and services. Some restaurants or places in Taiwan cater to relatively wealthy clientale. These people may be making a Western salary or work for an international business in Taiwan and so their salaries -- though modest in the West -- lets them buy absurdly expensive things in Taiwan. Of course, it's all a matter of expensive. A burger costing 10$ in the US is sometimes a great deal; but in Taiwan, it means you're living the high life. I've found foreigner settings are like this; as are stores in Taipei or upscale establishments in Kaohsiung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Category 3: Exportable/imported goods. This is where my divide by ten metric breaks down. Did you know that a small jar of Skippy's peanut butter costs 6 USD here?? Absurd, but I pay it nonetheless. Skippy's peanut butter, iPhones and other gadgets, USB cables, watches, saxophones, bikes all fall in this upper-tier price-range. They're things that your standard person still needs to buy -- including groceries! -- but I think because it's possible to export such products abroad, they charge standard international prices here (otherwise everyone would buy their laptops in Taiwan and fly them out to America later). Some things, like the peanut butter, are even more expensive here than in America because of shipping fees, I suppose. So strangely, a grocery store I think is one of the most expensive shops around (you're better off going to a fresh market, where the food is cheaper because it can't be exported abroad).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, a little bit about living abroad, pricing strategy and international trade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/7017114661643213104/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/11/prices-in-taiwan.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7017114661643213104'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7017114661643213104'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/11/prices-in-taiwan.html' title='Prices in Taiwan'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-3898743492653098655</id><published>2022-11-18T20:47:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2022-12-05T02:48:24.011-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Inputs and outputs</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I had a new idea occur to me yesterday as I was biking, so I'm going to chew it over here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about the question, "how do you define success?" Everyone has their own definition, of course. But I imagine that most definitions have something to do with a weighted combination of these factors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friendships and community&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Artistic output&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good health and athleticism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legacy (via. children, organizations)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career success or impact (not directed correlated with money)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Money (net worth, income)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I break down success into these aspects, I can more or less imagine what my goals are. For instance, artistic output: to make music, to be able to draw or blog and make things that are worth reading or listening to. With friendships, it's to have a lot of cool people around me that I enjoy being around. That's all great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of this blog post is that these things are &lt;i&gt;outputs&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;inputs &lt;/i&gt;to life. For instance, you can put a lot of effort into making friends and search all over town for your people, but it's not a given that you'll find them. That depends on the city you live in, what organizations are around, the personality of your city/town, &lt;i&gt;in addition &lt;/i&gt;to your own friend-making mindset. The same thing goes for money, career success, good health, etc. You can put effort and orient your life around those things, but that doesn't mean necessarily that you'll be "successful" in those respects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's cliche, but a lot of trouble comes when we base our self-worth on things outside of our control. It's cliche and yet, I still find myself doing it. This person runs a 5k faster than I do; this person earns more money than me; this person has a more active social life. Of course, their output may make them look more "successful" but you actually may have been putting in more work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what are the inputs to this equation? Inputs are things that we can directly adjust about our own life. It doesn't require help from our external environments, it just requires you reading, learning, and digging deep. Not easy, but possible, and within your control. I thought of three important inputs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mindset/personality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Routine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills. Pretty simple, but it helps to see how this connects to life outputs. Skills are things like learning a language, computer programming, mathematics, public speaking. Most people want to learn skills for some external reason -- it can help them get a job or pursue a hobby. Skills grow slowly but I do think that they're mostly in your control. You can learn almost anything from Youtube, reading books (which you can pirate), etc. With good skills you can advance your career, make money, produce more artistic content, etc. Of course, there is some reverse causality; with more money you can hire a coach or teacher for certain skills. Still, even people with all the money in the world don't learn (say) how to play the piano faster. They maybe just have more time and focus to dedicate to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindset. Now this is a hard one, but important. I think your mindset affects all sorts of things in your life: your resilience, your persistence with things you want to pursue, your attitude towards meeting people or maintaining connects. Being a go-getter, being out-going (when needed) or fully focused on studying (when needed) are all traits of a good personality (to me), but that depends on what outputs you're orienting towards. A lot of people I think are successful in companies or in certain jobs because they have a good mindset for it, and that lets them learn the requisite skills. For instance, in computer programming you have to have the persistence to debug and debug until you find the issue. In teaching (my job right now), you must stay above the whims of every single student and keep the goal of the lesson in mind. Mindset can be cultivated by reflection, meditation, reading books, practicing good thought-patterns. But as with anything we start with a certain mindset given by our parents, teachers, and peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine. I've found that routine is important for actually deploying / growing skills and making use of a good mindset. For instance, you can have a great mindset and skill at learning a foreign language but if you don't carve out time in your schedule for it regularly, you won't really progress [see note below].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there's a lot of ways that these three things -- skills, mindset, and routine -- factor into your outputs. Too many combinations to discuss here... but regardless, the point is that to define "success" you should look at inputs: what you're putting into your life. You may disagree on what exact inputs you believe are important or relevant to your life but there are some for everybody. Outputs, again, vary by the person but all of them are too unpredictable. Tracking something out of your control might make your feel bad, or (worse yet) give you an inflated ego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so going forward I want to thing about my inputs. Am I focusing on developing skills that I care about and enjoy? Am I cultivating a positive mindset in my endeavors (social, professional, interest-wise)? And am I establishing a consistent routine in my life to make use of my time? Whoosh. Big questions, and I'm no self-help blogger, so best I stay away from topics like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Note: About time. Time is interesting -- is it an input or an output? Some people always are yearning for more time; students, working professionals, well really anyone. But some people have more time than they know what to do with, like kids on summer vacation. Time I think has to be combined with a routine, mindset, or skill you're focusing on to be put to good use. I'd say time is an environmental factor. At a given stage in your life, you can't really control how much of it you have. But you can routinize it so that it's better structured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/3898743492653098655/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/11/inputs-and-outputs.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3898743492653098655'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3898743492653098655'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/11/inputs-and-outputs.html' title='Inputs and outputs'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-1493990367100436206</id><published>2022-09-03T04:38:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2022-09-03T04:38:17.882-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The beginnings of wisdom</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This week I had the first signs of wisdom. For years I had seen it coming, it and its three siblingns. It emerged from the back of my mouth. It pained my head and ears and mouth and throat and made it hard to eat. And now, it is here. It makes me wonder -- what left do I have in the realm of my dental development? And does this "wisdom tooth" really make me so wise? I think not... though some say that is the beginnings of wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-light-theme" id="simple-translate"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-button isShow" style="background-image: url(&amp;quot;moz-extension://51173a79-5a5d-42fd-a1bd-54c53162968d/icons/512.png&amp;quot;); height: 22px; left: 701px; top: 124px; width: 22px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-panel " style="font-size: 13px; height: 200px; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-wrapper" style="overflow: hidden;"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-move" draggable="true"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="simple-translate-result-contents"&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-result" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="simple-translate-candidate" dir="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/1493990367100436206/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/09/the-beginnings-of-wisdom.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/1493990367100436206'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/1493990367100436206'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/09/the-beginnings-of-wisdom.html' title='The beginnings of wisdom'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-3005307541490932907</id><published>2022-08-31T20:33:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2022-08-31T20:40:46.787-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>One month later in Taiwan</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The end of this week marks my first month of teaching in Taiwan, and five whole weeks in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching has also been a great joy. According to my visa status, it's why I'm in the country. It's a job 
that pays well -- especially by local standards -- and allows me to buy 
an inordinate number of watermelon smoothies each month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I teach four different groups of kids, each meeting twice a week: one group of little ones (7-9 years old); one slightly older bunch; one group that's 10-12; and an "advanced" class that's around 12-14. I think they're all wonderful, thoughtful, hardworking kids in their own ways, and every day I get to know them a little better. I've learned that my littlest class loves to draw, color, sing, and make art. I've learned that my most energetic classes love to "shake it out" and do an exercise break in the middle of class. I've learned that my oldest class can tackle the social deduction game Werewolf, and can even have a debate about whether kids should have smart devices (all in a second language!). I've learned that some of my most vocal kids -- the CEO-types -- have horrible grammar compared to their classmates, and sometimes the child quietly in the corner has got every unit nailed and is just waiting to ace the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've learned a great number of things about the English language. I've learned that it's very hard to know when to put "the" before a noun. I've learned that past tense verbs are extremely inconsistent -- and honestly I feel horrible that these children have to memorize "bring &amp;gt; brought, fall &amp;gt; fell, catch &amp;gt; caught" till their eyeballs fall out. I've learned that more often then not, when I see a mistake in a sentence I have no idea how &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;it's wrong according to English grammar rules -- and that frustrates me to know end. If English were a programming language, it would've been made obselete decades ago for it's stringiness, ridiculous taxonomy, and bizarre structural design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My co-workers at school have been a welcome community. We English teachers congregate for twenty minutes in the breakroom every Wednesday and Friday, when most of us have a full day of seven hours of teaching. I wolf down my lunch and listen to their stories, occasionally asking "where's a good dentist around Kaohsiung" and receiving a host of recommendations. I'm friendly with the Chinese staff, and often overwhelmed with gratitude when they drop everything to teach me how to put staples in a stapler, or copy unit tests for a class in ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of teaching and talking to my roommate, Leon, I operate mostly in Mandarin. I'm simultaneously pleased with how much my Mandarin is improving and overwhelmed by how far I need to go. I feel like I can articulate myself, my feelings, my thoughts. I've told people about why I want to study Chinese in Mandarin; I've told people why I'm vegan, and specifically why I don't eat eggs and milk; I've told people how "I'm American... though my parents are Indian" more times than I can count. I can ask questions to people about their lives, how to get to the nearest YouBike station, what there is to do in Taiwan. And sometimes, their answers are intelligible. Yet when I hear native speakers talking at a break-neck pace, or when I hear the news or glance at a menu or a newspaper, I feel like my years of study have amounted to nothing. Though I can articulate myself, my speech lacks the color of my language skills English. My words are imprecise and often incorrectly ordered or otherwise deployed. Never am I certain I'm doing something right, yet by sheer necessity, I go for it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has helped a great deal here that people in Taiwan are incredibly friendly. I had heard that before but didn't realize the full extent to which it was true. I feel very welcomed from everyone, including: my landlord Michael, who drove me and three others to Kending; the Laoban (boss) at my daily stop "Mama Zhang's Vegetarian"; the ladies running the fruit stall on Sanduo road, conveniently on my walk back from work; Carrie, the doorman at the apartment, who loves learning new English words; the man who sits at a coffeeshop down the street translating heavy English books about Chinese historiography; a new friend of mine from Brazil who teaches drumming to kids here and comes most days to Mama Zhang's as well. People ask me where I'm from, they compliment my Mandarin (people's expectations are incredibly low for foreigner's Chinese level), and how I'm doing, and sometimes they teach me new words or phrases. It's more than I could expect of strangers or acquaintances anywhere, let alone in a new and hitherto foreign country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all that, at times I feel at a loss for friend-making in a new city. I've only experienced one move before: from London to Berkeley. It was hard then too, but I was encompassed by the thriving college life with countless groups and people to meet. In post-grad, things seem different. Life rhythms are slowly, and socializing centers around the weekend, when most everyone's free. I've felt great empathy for people who move to a new country knowing no 
one, not knowing the language, and trying to build a life. In a new city, I don't know yet how to plug myself in. I have aspirations like playing saxophone, badminton/ping pong, running, but little idea of how to make them come trrue. In a new place, chancing upon regularly occuring groups -- something akin to a group of friends -- is a special treasure. I've had some good encounters -- a language exchange group off Facebook, a saxophone choir that plays old Chinese songs, and some folks playing badminton near my work! -- and so I'm hopeful that something to stick. Still, moving is hard. I'm grateful that my job lifts my spirits and I have Leon to talk with, otherwise things would be even harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mid-Autumn Festival is next week here in Taiwan. Though I've studied the vocab words in Chinese class, I'm excited to experience it in-person. And perhaps I'm more excited for Kaohsiung's summer heat to die down, so maybe walking outside in the afternoon will be more bearable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/3005307541490932907/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/one-month-later-in-taiwan.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3005307541490932907'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3005307541490932907'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/one-month-later-in-taiwan.html' title='One month later in Taiwan'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-7839048156083221662</id><published>2022-08-02T18:02:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2022-08-02T20:50:42.837-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>A morning in Kaohsiung</title><content type='html'>&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif;"&gt;This
morning I walked outside for the first time in Taiwan! What a lovely
experience. People were quite friendly. I got the sense that it’s a bigish city
so not super common to talk to people, but some people still said “zao” or “ni
hao”. I looked into the courtyard of some retirement complex and an old man – I
didn’t understand his occupation, but looked like a cleaner or garbageman? –
said “how do you do?” in English. It was funny, kinda with a Texan accent. He
asked me in Chinese what I’m doing in Taiwan and I told him. In general, I
think a lot of people were looking at me cause I stick out being a foreigner
(when I looked back, they quickly glanced in a different direction). I only saw
one other foreigner – a 30-something bald guy walking a beagle at the park. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif;"&gt;I
mostly saw old people around town, since I set off at 6am. I enjoyed looking
around at 7-11. They are super common and seem pretty useful – they have printing,
garbage, different foods, toys, etc. 7-11 was the only brand I recognized. I
can’t say for sure, but it seemed like here, there were mostly small businesses
and restaurants, though some fancier, perhaps multi-restaurant chains here and
there. It’s a nice contrast to Berkeley/America, where almost half of the
businesses you see are national / multi-national chains. Around the 7-11 and
the MRT there were some young people at / heading to work. The MRT at the Central
Park was incredible in its design, even though all I saw was the escalator. I
also saw one ad for a city-council candidate. I believe the local elections are
in November, much like in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif;"&gt;My
favorite part was the Central Park here in Kaohsiung, which was 15ish minutes from
where I’m staying. It’s a beautiful place with a lake, island in the lake,
bridges. Lots of groups of old men and women doing Taichi. Some playing tennis,
or stretching, or massaging their backs on the trees. The best sight was a
group of old ladies who were using the thick roots of an old tree as a place to
lounge. No chairs, but they were all sitting or leaning on the undergrowth
(which was in the air) and vibing. Like elves, truly. If I grow old, I hope I
can live in Taiwan or be as active as all these people. One old guy even did
pull-ups after me, he said, “hen bu cuo. Hen bang.” I was flattered, but really,
he’s the “bang”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif;"&gt;The
streets here are super large. Like, five lanes wide on the biggest streets, and
2-4 on the small ones. I wonder if there are places in the city which are more
pedestrian (maybe the night markets), or if those settings are more found in
Taipei. I enjoyed walking through the alley ways which were adorned with plants,
and some small businesses and homes. On the biggest streets, there were loads
of vehicles whizzing by – many cars and many more scooters. They were all going
very fast. And my, at one traffic light there was a huge slew of scooters at
the front of the line. I saw a good number of people biking (maybe about one
third of the number of scooters). On the big roads, I was pleased to see that
there were sidewalks, and the sidewalks were big enough to bike on, so it’s
safer than being on the road. In general, Kaohsiung so far reminded me of Bangalore
of Chennai, except everything’s in Chinese. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif;"&gt;I’ve
had some degree of sensory deprivation sitting in this hotel room. So it was
incredibly vibrant and refreshing to go out. Maybe we should make it a worldwide
requirement for tourists to spend 3 full days in a hotel before they see the
country they’re visiting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I plan on sending it out just twice a year (around January &amp;amp; July). This way, I can share about my life and elaborate more than I could in an Instagram post description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This list also makes me remember to keep in touch with family and friends, past and present. If you are reading this and it's been a while since we've talked, drop me a line, long or short! I hope we can catch up soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So onto the updates! In this post: Graduation, Music &amp;amp; Arts, Research, and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Graduation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to believe but in May I did graduate from UC Berkeley! I thouroughly enjoyed my time there, and I was especially grateful for this last year being in-person. &lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVFOH180wCi-3-Z131GxUXohUqG4dI40KoxUa60vf1xfOEPOldJO4vXQPxibs9Lj1mgvcuKKVfziiWVwJhGhnrrKqDNtAP1ugBzwgGSucosWr6lfFol-XITUgvAnSoVzGrMu8YhwGOlGgkv4PqvN9fbFActuWrnHeggW2yorL4NK9ZlYH908i5-szm/s1024/WhatsApp%20Image%202022-05-15%20at%208.02.20%20PM.jpeg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="1024" data-original-width="768" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVFOH180wCi-3-Z131GxUXohUqG4dI40KoxUa60vf1xfOEPOldJO4vXQPxibs9Lj1mgvcuKKVfziiWVwJhGhnrrKqDNtAP1ugBzwgGSucosWr6lfFol-XITUgvAnSoVzGrMu8YhwGOlGgkv4PqvN9fbFActuWrnHeggW2yorL4NK9ZlYH908i5-szm/w150-h200/WhatsApp%20Image%202022-05-15%20at%208.02.20%20PM.jpeg" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduation was quite the riot. The stadium was unbearably hot, and the audio quality sucked. So all the famous people on-stage spoke to a fidgetty and distracted crowd of students on the field of Memorial Stadium. I had a great time nonetheless -- it was like a 6,000 person mixer! After graduation, I spent a week with my parents in Yosemite National Park.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then I stayed in Berkeley for a few weeks packing up and saying goodbye to friends. I will miss my friends, the joy of being a student, the charms of the city and Berkeleyans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Music &amp;amp; Arts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last semester was an extremely fruitful time for me. Since I had finished most requirements for the economics degree, I was fortunate enough to take two performing arts classes. One was theater, where we did various scenes and monologs and even musical theater throughout the semester. I had a wonderful, energetic teacher and most other students in the class were sweet young freshmen, so it was a wholesome time. A recording of me doing a Forrest Gump monolog is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvw-8N6sMrI&amp;amp;ab_channel=rohantohab"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also took a class in jazz improvisation and reconnected with my study of the saxophone. I had another &lt;a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/04/office-hours-with-ben-goldberg.html"&gt;incredible teacher&lt;/a&gt;. We focused partly on music theory and partly on free jazz and playing &lt;i&gt;like you mean it&lt;/i&gt;. That last part really struck a chord in me... Before, I was used to reading the notes on a page and playing them as accurately as possible. But now, I've realized that there's infinite ways to play any song, and so many ideas that can only be expressed through music (or sound). Some ideas are ugly, some are beautiful, but that's all part of art. I'd like to share recordings etc. of me playing music at some point, when I decide how!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, one small thing I learned recently was how to use music notation software. So here's song I wrote about Tamiami Boulevard. It's a main drag near my parents' new home in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholbtvytw_DgOOmgefCDnfVF5jthxnkYxPbOqDLDGtomLttBBT5sixVvd4cV2dqSZlCZb8ub9Ai1v_ApYADjefbTx-yQpRKL8P9lQuB2vU34u5HYsZTqrPY5oUtQnFTqqg7mlhlSMIu1k6ilDpG5eTBf5SVCGLNnSOyXhrI9XtnZTsMebCMY-pmRTm/s1225/down%20tamiami.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="417" data-original-width="1225" height="187" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholbtvytw_DgOOmgefCDnfVF5jthxnkYxPbOqDLDGtomLttBBT5sixVvd4cV2dqSZlCZb8ub9Ai1v_ApYADjefbTx-yQpRKL8P9lQuB2vU34u5HYsZTqrPY5oUtQnFTqqg7mlhlSMIu1k6ilDpG5eTBf5SVCGLNnSOyXhrI9XtnZTsMebCMY-pmRTm/w548-h187/down%20tamiami.png" width="548" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote an academic paper that's coming out in October! It's a review paper on the &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-resource-111920-010503"&gt;"Economics of the Wildlife Trade and Consumption"&lt;/a&gt;. I've been working on this paper part-time since the summer of 2020 and pleased to say it's in its final version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn't directly do empirical research but summarized the significant discoveries thus far and reframed it for economists. I'm grateful to Gordon Rausser and David Zilberman, my co-authors. They are well-established agricultural economists and guided me through the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm proud of the work. I now feel more knowledgable about the wildlife trade than I ever thought I would be. The wildlife trade has numerous causes (as you might read in the abstract) and results in threats to endangered species, serious animal exploitation, and increased risks of creating pandemics like COVID-19. I was happy to work on a project I felt was important and neglected by economists and social scientists generally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, throughout the process I realized that academia is slow, solitary work. As much as I enjoyed the topic, there were times were I got de-motivated working at my computer so much, especially without any peers to talk through ideas with. So I take it as a lesson for what kind of work I want to do in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taiwan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just moved to Taiwan! I'm teaching at an English "cram school" (after-school, supplementary education) called Schoolhouse Language Center in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaohsiung"&gt;Kaohsiung City&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced: GAO-shiong). My friend from Berkeley, Leon, is also with me teaching at the same school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihmHkcuYoUaahf4rUEVnzY5xApa9afq_rackfk85mZ3cC87BeZiJd5y2SkUizMB4i1CwTve85uHpU9EsHcFvw76cx4Gs3uwnX8LHcrGSqdmz6M-dJRK7WQqy9uD7jolDVQfFfofBKZOyE4_M9AOoHO4ilangCYJCltNb5zNw3ExlfO6gbtXzqaI2O5/s2000/WhatsApp%20Image%202022-07-30%20at%209.22.52%20AM.jpeg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="1500" data-original-width="2000" height="154" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihmHkcuYoUaahf4rUEVnzY5xApa9afq_rackfk85mZ3cC87BeZiJd5y2SkUizMB4i1CwTve85uHpU9EsHcFvw76cx4Gs3uwnX8LHcrGSqdmz6M-dJRK7WQqy9uD7jolDVQfFfofBKZOyE4_M9AOoHO4ilangCYJCltNb5zNw3ExlfO6gbtXzqaI2O5/w205-h154/WhatsApp%20Image%202022-07-30%20at%209.22.52%20AM.jpeg" width="205" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot people are thrown off to hear this update. People also sometimes confuse Taiwan with Thailand, Vietnam, or China. It's understandable. But Taiwan is a unique and remarkable island! Mandarin, English and Taiwanese are the main languages here. It's an incredibly safe and well-run democratic place. Public transport in the cities is extremely efficient, and there's a high-speed rail that runs from Taipei to Kaohsiung.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a rich culture of vegetarian food because of Taiwan's history of Buddhism. In general, I think there's a lot to learn and experience, and this kind of move wouldn't be as easy when I'm later in my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large part of my motivation for living in Taiwan is to immerse myself in Mandarin. I studied Mandarin in middle/high school, but never got to a decent level of fluency, and I've never spent a substantial time in a Mandarin-speaking country. I enjoy speaking, reading and writing Chinese and think that it will be a useful language to know as China becomes a more central global power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying so far, it has been humbling. There's so much knowledge of English vocabulary, grammar, and literature that I've accumulated over the years, and it's over-whelming to rebuild all that in Chinese. But I'm grateful to my Taiwanese/Chinese-American friends who have been helping me speak with them. I wrote a couple stories in Chinese which &lt;a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/diary-practice.html"&gt;you can read here&lt;/a&gt; (shout-out to my editor!). I also may start a Instagram (ugh, I know) or something recording my experience here... but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be well, joyful and healthy these next few months!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/482154269453403882/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/2022-07-semiannual-update.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/482154269453403882'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/482154269453403882'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/2022-07-semiannual-update.html' title='2022-08 Semiannual Update'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVFOH180wCi-3-Z131GxUXohUqG4dI40KoxUa60vf1xfOEPOldJO4vXQPxibs9Lj1mgvcuKKVfziiWVwJhGhnrrKqDNtAP1ugBzwgGSucosWr6lfFol-XITUgvAnSoVzGrMu8YhwGOlGgkv4PqvN9fbFActuWrnHeggW2yorL4NK9ZlYH908i5-szm/s72-w150-c-h200/WhatsApp%20Image%202022-05-15%20at%208.02.20%20PM.jpeg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-5739207913000557360</id><published>2022-08-01T12:51:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2022-08-01T12:51:33.467-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Diary Practice</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-fa4b49b7-7fff-c99f-161b-3b923fc7f16d" style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: pre;"&gt;七月五號&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;今天我终于决定我必须要去外面跑步。在佛羅里達外面很热，所以直到今天以前，我一直打算去跑步但是我总是没出去。&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 我晚上八点出去。当时，太陽還沒下山 (我媽不讓我晚上出門,因為她擔心我遇到蛇)。我跑地（得）有一點慢,因為我幾天沒運動了. 但是,我跑步途中,
 開始下一點雨.我想一想, 這樣下雨不錯! 但是, 在佛羅里達一下雨上了, 就下得很厲害. 今天也不例外. 突然, 
我的衣服看起來像我剛才去游泳! 哇塞. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 下雨的時候去外面跑步有一些好處. 比方說, 我回家以後, 我不需要洗澡! 哈哈我開玩笑. 真的好處是: 第一, 天氣比較涼快, 所以我跑得比較快! 第二個好處是水坑讓我赤腳跑步比較舒服. 而且, 我回家時看到一隻青蛙!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 我跑步快結束的時候, 我看到雷電!. 我感到擔心. 我媽已經對蛇涉很感到可怕害怕/擔心, 她他對雷會怎麼想? 因此我趕緊 很快回家敲門. 
我爸爸已經準備了一條毛巾歡迎我回家. 我叫我媽, "媽媽別著急!我安全得到家了!" 但是她沒聽到我, 因為她在外面, 高興地欣賞著雨!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;July 5th (translated via Google Translate)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;Today
 I finally decided that I have to go outside for a run. It's hot outside
 in Florida, so until today I've been going for a run but I never get 
out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;I
 go out at eight o'clock at night. At that time, the sun had not yet set
 (my mother would not let me go out at night because she was worried 
that I would encounter snakes). I'm running a little slow because I 
haven't exercised for a few days. However, during my run, it started to 
rain a little. I think about it, it's raining good! Great. Today was no 
exception. Suddenly, my clothes looked like I just went swimming! Wow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;Going
 outside for a run when it's raining has some benefits. For example, 
when I get home, I don't need to take a shower! Haha I'm joking. The 
real benefits are: First, it's cooler, so I run faster! Second The good 
thing is that the puddles make it more comfortable for me to run 
barefoot. Also, I saw a frog when I got home!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;Towards
 the end of my run, I saw thunder and lightning!. I was worried. My mom 
was already terrified/worried about the snake, what would she think of 
thunder? So I hurried home and knocked on the door. My dad A towel had 
been prepared to welcome me home. I called my mom, "Don't worry mom! I 
got home safely!" But she didn't hear me because she was outside, 
happily admiring the rain!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;七月十三號&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;今天我想談談我跟乒乓球的關係. 聽說, 在大陸和台灣乒乓球是很熱門的運動. (中國人每次都贏乒乓奧運冠軍!) &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 我在倫敦時, 我父母買一個玩意兒, 他可以從餐桌變型成乒乓求桌! 很棒, 很方便, 所以我當時很經常打乒乓球. 本來, 我每天想跟我父母打乒乓球. 但是, 我的乒乓球進步很多, 所以我們一玩我每次都贏. 我很感謝我父母讓我有這樣的乒乓球的起源故事. (其實, 因為真的乒乓球桌比較大一點, 到今天, 用真的桌子我有一點不習慣).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 有一天, 我請了我們的鄰居的男孩子來我家. 他叫約翰, 比我大一歲. 從那天起, 我們開很好朋友. 但是更重要的是: 他的乒乓球很厲害. 各個周末, 我們每天會花至少兩小時打乒乓球. 在他學校, 約翰也打乒乓球, 但是他的同學們打得還可以. 所以我們兩個是互相最強大的對手.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 我們就像陰和陽. 他是左撇子, 我是右撇子. 他用旋轉球, 我用扣殺. 他的乒乓球拍很凹凸不平, 我的很光滑. 就這樣, 我們從七歲到十六歲切磋 (十六歲之後, 我們兩個都很忙, 就沒有很多時間玩乒乓球). 每次我們的比賽都差不多平分了. 這樣讓我們每次繼續 -- 下一次, 誰會呢？誰要贏了?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 現在, 約翰住在英國, 我住在美國. 他還是我遇過最強大的乒乓球對手. 現在, 我只有一個夢想. 我希望我在台灣可以練習我的乒乓球. 之後我和約翰相遇, 我會贏的!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;July 13th &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;(translated via Google Translate)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;Today I want to talk about my relationship with table tennis. I heard that table tennis is a very popular sport in mainland China and Taiwan. (Chinese people win the table tennis Olympic championship every time!).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;When I was in London, my parents bought something that could transform from a dining table to a ping pong table! It was great and convenient, so I played ping pong a lot at the time. Originally, I wanted to play ping pong with my parents every day. But , My table tennis has improved a lot, so I win every time we play. I am very grateful to my parents for letting me have such a table tennis origin story. (Actually, because the real table tennis table is a bit bigger, to this day, I'm not used to using a real table).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;One day, I invited our neighbor's boy to my house. His name is John, and he is a year older than me. We have been good friends since that day. But more importantly: his table tennis is great. Every weekend , we will spend at least two hours a day playing table tennis. In his school, John also plays table tennis, but his classmates can play well. So the two of us are each other's strongest opponents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;We are like yin and yang. He's left-handed, I'm right-handed. He spins the ball, I smash. His ping pong bat is bumpy, mine is smooth. Years of learning from each other (after the age of sixteen, both of us are so busy that we don't have a lot of time to play table tennis). Every time our game is almost evenly divided. So let's continue each time -- next time, who will win? Who is going to win?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VIiyi" lang="en"&gt;&lt;span class="JLqJ4b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="zh-CN" data-number-of-phrases="1" data-phrase-index="0"&gt;&lt;span class="Q4iAWc"&gt;Now, John lives in the UK and I live in the US. He is also the strongest ping pong opponent I have ever met. Now, I only have one dream. I hope I can practice my ping pong in Taiwan. After I met John, I will win!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/5739207913000557360/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/diary-practice.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5739207913000557360'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5739207913000557360'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/08/diary-practice.html' title='Diary Practice'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-6434165754901712402</id><published>2022-07-11T12:02:00.007-07:00</published><updated>2022-07-11T12:04:14.412-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>How Rohan Plays Chess -- A Career Framework</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I decide which moves to play in chess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think of a handful of non-stupid moves to play&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broadly look at how each move would advance my position&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short-list to one or two moves I like based on:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The opponent’s position&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What I’m familiar with&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My gut feeling (this may be the deciding factor)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before you move, calculate a few moves ahead to make sure your chosen move isn’t a blunder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If it is, go back to your initial list or short-list and repeat this step.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If it isn’t, play the move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some situations where this algorithm isn’t necessary, and you can choose a move much quicker:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to get out of a situation like check or prevent a checkmate at all costs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s a major opportunity on the board that would be game-changing. Taking a queen or rook, for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or controlling the center of the board. This has no immediate material advantage, but actually provides benefits later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here are some stylized facts from this framework:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every chess game is different.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No matter how sure you are of your strategy, your opponent’s moves have a huge impact on the game. So you can’t feasibly think 10-20 moves in advance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advice has limited value. There may be some general principles, but those are often overshadowed by the specifics of the game. Advice can also be overshadowed by your style of playing chess and what you feel comfortable doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The goal of the opening is to set up for a strong middle game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although there are some situations where you can checkmate in two or four moves, those situations extremely rare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So don’t get greedy. In the beginning, carefully develop your pieces rather than gunning for a check-mate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no one right opening. It depends on how you like to play.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But know that your opening will, in an unpredictable way, affect the rest of your game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;But what positions are worth striving for? How do you choose which opponents to face?

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;In music there is a
constant struggle. Struggle to learn your instrument, struggle to transcribe,
struggle to keep up, struggle in your ensemble. Struggle as a verb, an abstract
action. Struggle for expression, justice, freedom as a political idea. Musicians
approach this in a variety of ways -- pop songs may smooth over the struggle,
except for moments when the singer's voice cracks and they say how they really
feel. Steve Lacy, the Bite is a constant struggle; it shows what is behind the
beautiful sounds that we sometimes hear in music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;What draws you to Steve Lacy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;In the album with
The Bite, Lacy was experimenting with "extended techniques", ideas;
hence his somewhat harsh, overbiting. In 1979 or so, I was in Berkeley at
Rasputin music carrying around my soprano saxophone. The man at the till said,
"You play soprano sax? Steve Lacy was just here! You have to listen to
this." and I bought the album Evidence (1962). The sound. It's incredible.
It's so hard to do that on soprano saxophone. For 10 or 15 years I worked to
emulate Steve Lacy's sound on the soprano; I transcribed the entire album. I
wasn't able to do it, but the process of struggle made me the player I am
today. I tried for years to play like Steve Lacy and now I play like Ben
Goldberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;How do you find your people?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;At your age, it's
easy. I used to ask people if we could study together. That's how one album of
mine came together -- it was because I felt embarrassed at jam sessions not
knowing all the charts, and I told a guitarist I wanted to study all the songs
we did know. It turned into an album of funked up bebop songs that started with
a central purpose: to study. To study is to do more than "play"
together; it's to strive for betterment and progress on the instrument. The
other tip of finding your people is to be polite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;And, you can study
with other artists. What does it mean to create something with a painter? A
cartoonist? A poet? An actor? What piece of music would come from looking at a
painting? What painting would come from a piece of music? Wisdom and exchange
of ideas in art transcends the particular craft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Others chimed in…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;What if you played
music throughout your day. Someone Finn knew had a 30bpm metronome running for
his entire day; and every time it beeped, he would do something rhythmic or
musical. The purpose was to internalize the pulse. Music can be like that. Your
every waking, and sleeping moment can be musical if you make it. Why is there a
dichotomy between making music and living life normally? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Recording is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;It's essential.
Record as much as you possibly can. Every recording carries a memory; a story;
an accident of people getting together to create music.&lt;/p&gt;

Can I see your W2?</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Taxes have always seemed like the most absurdly, adulty, agonizing thing you can ever get up to on a Sunday afternoon. The kids are out playing baseball; dogs are playing fetch at a ball game; but the adults are stuck inside with a calculator, pen and pencil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year was my first time doing taxes. It feels like some kind of twisted rite of passage: Hello, and welcome to adulthood! Can I see your W2?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the first thing they ask for. W2. W2. W2. Who decided on this name? Magically, everyone's meant to have one. For most jobs, it's easy and handed in through the mail. But for my summer internship, for example, the W2 was stored secretly on this magical portal that I registered with my work email which was deactivated and I forgot the password so I could access it so I emailed HR and they actually changed their name to People Ops so the emails didn't get through and when I finally &lt;i&gt;did &lt;/i&gt;get through, they told me to call the portal help desk, which was listed on the website the entire damn time. So then I get talking to this nice woman named Julia -- people on these phone lines really appreciate it when you remember their name for the entire five minutes you talk to them -- and after she interrogated me about my childhood pet name, she let me have my god damn W2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you get all your W2's in place -- the stars are aligned -- and that's not the end of it. It would be nice -- and it's not like this -- if filing taxes were like an ATM where you just slide in your documents and bam, they work it all out for you. Not that inconcievable, right? Well, that's not how it's done in America. So because it's a free country they give you like 10 different tax filing services to choose from, and I manage to choose the wrong one that's way to complicated, and there's way too many boxes to add up... until I call my dad, an experienced, veteran adult, who tells me I should be using the 1040-EZ instead of the 1040. What a slap in the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's when I discover TurboTax. I had heard rumors about this -- mainly leftists including myself shitting on its creator, Intuit -- but I buckle down and go for TurboTax because the New York Times said I should. And suddenly, TurboTax is there to save the day. There's like confetti and pats on the back and when things get complicated, they tell me, "Don't worry. We're here to make it easy." and I suddenly realize why Americans look for a strong father figure in government. Daddy TurboTax is here for me with "his" calming voice and helpful how-tos. Truly, what a guy. In the end, TurboTax spits out this form that's incomprehensible to me -- even though I &lt;i&gt;studied economics &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;multivariable calculus &lt;/i&gt;(I was right all along -- they don't teach you &lt;i&gt;anything &lt;/i&gt;practical in high school) -- and amazingly I'm owed one thousand extra dollars than expected because of the COVID stimulus. I'd like to thank my parents -- Mom and Daddy TurboTax -- for this accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've always had this sense when looking at complicated things from afar that it's some kind of magic. Going through airport security was one of them. Cooking chana masala. Signing a lease. And finally (but not finally, because more of these will come up), doing taxes. But once you've done these things once or twice the magic wears away... and the importance of getting your macronutrients and paying the government money (so we can wage war abroad?) becomes apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adulting at first glance looks awfully boring. But if you're willing to sit through paperwork and logistical meetings and bureaucracies -- a somewhat big if -- then the world is open to you as an adult. As long as you have a floor to sleep on and food in your belly, you can literally do anything you want.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/7658088245822610757/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/04/welcome-to-adulthood-can-i-see-your-w2.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7658088245822610757'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7658088245822610757'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/04/welcome-to-adulthood-can-i-see-your-w2.html' title='Welcome to Adulthood!

It was my first time racing this distance and I exceeded expectations, running the Berkeley course in 44:54. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was substantially faster than I had been expecting! In high school, I only ran 5k races and at the start of the season, my times were normally in the 22-23 minute area. 10k is double that, and recently I haven't done a ton of running, so I was aiming for 50 minutes. So I did pretty well! Around 45 minutes means I was running 7:14 miles throughout, and I placed 62 out of 1290 people in the race. I should give my tandem biking excursions with Dean more credit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a great time and was lucky to have my friends David, Leon, Imon and Leo to support me (even at 8:30am). They gave me a great oomph and found several places throughout the course to come support. We met a few others friends and saw so many athletic folks around Berkeley! I didn't anticipate anyone joining to watch but was happy to see them around the course. David knows how to motivate distance runners, having done mountain biking himself, and put on quite the show. Leon thinks that the best spectators should get medals (I fondly remember one supporter on Southside who wore a batman suit). I also was roped into the race by Tynan and Catherine -- they sadly had a fall halfway through and didn't get to the end :'(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The race started downtown, from the Deep South (Berkeley, CA) through campus up till North Side and then finished around the starting line. The last bit few kilometers were extremely hilly, and I saw the front runners of the race steaming down the hills. Honestly, I was tired at the 5k mark, but managed to keep up steam throughout the course. Leo ran alongside me for some of it -- we paced together on a track yesterday and he told me that on the uphills I was runing a solid 50-minute pace. The downhills were joyous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With middle-long distance races, I really feel the true race starts in the last half of the course. The runners have thinned out; people who went hard at the start may begin to burn out. With the hills and sparse mile markings, it became a real mental game. Though my thighs were aching I managed to get through it all and run till the very end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the 10k distance. It's long enough that you don't have to sprint and short enough that it's not brutal. I felt so great after the race would love to train for it more. Leo thinks I could run sub-40 -- who knows! It feels good to be part of a large, semi-athletic community and see improvements over time. You'll see me out there again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/5143521613796864207/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/02/berkeley-10k-race.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5143521613796864207'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5143521613796864207'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2022/02/berkeley-10k-race.html' title='Berkeley 10k Race'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-3614517474433417486</id><published>2022-01-31T23:00:00.003-08:00</published><updated>2022-01-31T23:04:38.529-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Killing Fields by Roland Joffe</title><content type='html'>&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;I truly enjoyed our first day of "Hacks of the Silver Screen", a course with Mark Danner. The theme is
journalists in film -- how films have shown journalists as heroes, scoundrels,
or something in-between throughout the years of American cinema.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;Today, we watched &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Killing Fields&lt;/span&gt;. It's a story about an
American journalist and his Cambodian "fixie" documenting the
"secret bombings in Cambodia" that led up to (and arguably caused)
the Cambodian genocide. I didn't know much about the Cambodian genocide before
-- or even that the Americans were involved (not that I was surprised). The film gave a gruesome and real depiction of the devastation caused by American military
decisions seemingly without regard for the Cambodian people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;Sam Waterson plays
Sydney Schanberg, the New York Times journalist who was trying to convey the
situation to the American public. Haing S. Ngor is a fantastic Cambodian actor
who plays Dith Pran, the "fixie" (interpreter, translator, assistant,
etc.) who saves Schanberg's life many times over... but Pran isn't able to be evacuated,
and is held captive by the dictatorial Khmer Rouge (the Maoist Communist Party
that conducted a military coup) until he escapes. To me, Pran is the hero of
the story -- there's no way he could be paid enough for what he did. With all his negotiation and smooth-talking he did the hard work
that got put under Schanberg's name at the awards (the film is by the way based
on a real story -- Pran and Schanberg both were reporters at the New York Times
when the film came out). Of course, he is only able to use his extraordinary
talents because of the connections that Schanberg had to the New York Times, to
diplomats, etc. Ultimately, the vast majority of Cambodians faced extreme
oppression and violence during this genocide and revolution. The "love
story" that Schanberg wrote dedicated to Pran falsely focuses on one man
rather than the millions that were affected by the "secret bombings"
of the country. I imagine Schanberg wrote about Pran as a way of atonement for unspeakable
violence that his country brought upon a formerly neutral nation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;There's a moment in
the film where Nixon is on TV speaking confidently about the Viet Nam /
Cambodian wars and the success of the "Nixon Doctrine". His method of
supposedly pursuing peace through the "development of allies and friends"
is juxtaposed with the brutal, senseless killings of civilians in Cambodia.
Schanberg asks again and again, "how many dead? How many injured?"
but there is no answer readily available. Nixon's method of expanding the
Vietnam War to Cambodia gave the Khmer Rouge the chance to gain power -- and
under their rule, more than one million people were killed and buried in the
sites in Cambodia known as the Killing Fields.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;Many such coups have
been backed by the American military in South East Asia and South America. It's
hard to say that America and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Americans &lt;/span&gt;are
not responsible for this. As our Professor mentioned in class, the War on
Terror in the Middle East have destabilized even more countries leaving them
vulnerable to undemocratic leadership. This has happened just in my lifetime -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;I watched in
heartbreak and powerlessness as the US withdrew from Afghanistan and the
Taliban overtook the country once again&lt;/span&gt;.
And so watching movies like the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Killing Field &lt;/span&gt;carries
a particular weight since the US remains a barbaric, hegemonic power that
threatens countries around the globe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;Maybe it's this gut-wrenching sense of
obligation that took Sydney Schanberg to risk his life and document the bombing
of Cambodia. Mixed in with his desire for fame and fortune is Schanberg's urge
to find the truth; and to speak that truth to those who will listen; and to
make right the injustice his country has brought on others. May we find that
urge in ourselves as we think about foreign policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;

In the year 2045, the world has gone through crisis after crisis of wars, poverty, and climate catostrophe. Meanwhile, virtual reality has reached a whole new level. Nearly everyone on the planet is plugged into the OASIS, a near-perfect simulation that has millions of planets, public schools, and institutions acting through completely anonymous avatars. Created by James Halliday, an unabashed 80s geek, the OASIS has come to dominate most people's reality. One day, Halliday dies&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;and leaves his entire fortune to the person who can solve his secret "easter egg" hidden in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest: I read this book in only two days. The sci-fi, fantastical world Ernest Cline builds is gripping, and so too is Wade Watts' (the protagonist) hunt for Halliday's egg. The obsession I had with the book probably mimics Cline's old obsessions with games ranging from Dungeons and Dragons in his youth to World of Warcraft later in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is geeky in a endearing but ignorant way. The influential characters of &lt;i&gt;Ready Player One &lt;/i&gt;are mostly nerdy, white men from mid-west America that flex their 80s pop culture references on every damn page. And why shouldn't they? Of course knowing the lines from &lt;i&gt;Monty Python and the Holy Grail &lt;/i&gt;should determine the fate of half a trillion dollars. But really, that's every nerd's dream -- for skills otherwise useless to society to make you a billionaire in a month. Think crypto, hedge funds, computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, this might be the world we're headed towards. My one memorable experience in virtual reality (VR) was a rollercoaster 
demo in an airport in Seoul, complete with a vibrating chair that shook 
you back and forth. Why sit in line for hours at Disneyland when you can
 the next best thing right in your living room? I was shockingly 
captivated. Our mobile phones, laptops, TVs have become increasingly 
immersive and the "real" world increasingly repungant. Some folks in the tech space&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;seem to have missed the anti-corporatist messages of the book, like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2021/oct/28/meta-mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-new-name-video"&gt;dear Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; who envisions his re-branded company building "a digital world built over our
 own, comprising virtual reality headsets and augmented reality".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and time again, we're asked to consider in the book: is this just a video game? At times I think that the joys of virtual reality -- however great -- can't be meaningful because, well, they're not &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt;. But as I went through the book I thought harder about that. Most of our institutions in America can be analogized to some kind of virtual reality. Our education system. The corporate ladder. Online shopping. These are spaces where arbitrary definitions of success -- like acing the SAT -- can yield massive material benefits to you personally. Now with COVID, these virtual realities have become even more commonplace. It's a fantastic, bizarre thing that you can conduct your entire life through a monitor and keyboard (heck, if we're doing that already, why not make it as enjoyable as OASIS?). In America, a "service-oriented" economy, one is actually &lt;i&gt;discouraged &lt;/i&gt;from pursuing activities like gardening, construction, or carpentry (unless you're some sort of hippie, or from Colorado). Everyone knows that &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;(a word I've come to question) opportunity lies in the virtual world*.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I read the book, I was reminded of Sufism, or mystical Islam. The way the doctrine was explained to me is that everything about ourselves -- what we see, do, how we act -- is an illusion. Deep down within us is our inner selves in the "Absolute Reality". Once we know our inner selves, the physical world becomes immaterial. True Sufis have a vastly different perspective on our place on this planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm not sure about all that. I do know that for all its geekiness and sci-fi tropes, &lt;i&gt;Ready Player One &lt;/i&gt;made me think a little harder about what is "real" and what's worth living for. I recommend the read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;* Karl Marx himself described the difference between the "real bodily form" of money and its "abstract exchange value". Money can be converted universally exactly because it is not tied down to a particular commodity. OASIS currency, as it happens in the book, becomes more stable than coins produced by a government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/9090370379340039184/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2021/12/ready-player-one-by-ernest-cline.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/9090370379340039184'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/9090370379340039184'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2021/12/ready-player-one-by-ernest-cline.html' title='Ready Player One by Ernest Cline'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-3880105311473727019</id><published>2021-10-03T14:09:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2021-10-03T14:09:23.995-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>blog ideas</title><content type='html'>&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;beyond meat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;what i did, learned&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;promise of alt-meat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;limitations;

The letter lies in my portfolio -- evidently it never reached the White House. I told him that, "I'm black just like you and that I'm proud that you are President."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a little confused about my ethnicity, but the point holds. Obama becoming the first Person of Color to hold the Office of the President was a big deal. I was young then, so it was hard for me to understand the significance of the moment. Now, I look back and wish we had more politicians as charming, intelligent, and dedicated as Obama was (not to discredit Donald Trump or Joe Biden).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course as I've come to Berkeley I've heard a number of criticisms of Obama. For all his talk about police reform or civil rights, what did he really do for Black justice? What's with his excessive drone strikes or detention of child migrants at the US-Mexico border? Obama's campaign was full of hope, unity, and courage, and to some his election signaled changing tides in America. But arguably, despite being of a different demographic, his presidency was more of what came before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having read his autobiography, I can tell that Obama regrets those short-comings too. Just as much as he emphasizes his ideals and the values he campaigned on, he also discusses the limitations of being President and the numerous influences on him. Being elected amid the Financial Crisis, Obama explains his choice of somewhat conservative economists in his cabinet; of Joe Biden, an experienced Senator, as his Vice President; how to best frame his platform ("spreading the wealth around", David Axelrod reminds us, reminds Americans of communism -- a big no) and how to tactfully avoid controversial topics of race (during the Presidential race, Obama had to cut ties with Reverend Jerimiah Wright because of his flagrant anti-White Supremacy preaching). In his book, he explains what it's like to approach Vladimir Putin in conversation, negotiate with military generals, and deal with the endless possibility of terrorism on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I read A Promised Land I felt the weight of the President's decisions... and I also felt the limitations of the Office. For instance, healthcare was a topic that Obama's advisors told him not to touch, simply because it would upset Pharmaceutical companies (who funded Democrats as well as Republicans) and be confusing to average Americans who already have good healthcare. They went through with Obamacare anyways, but not without calling in favors, pulling "behind the door deals", and watering down the Affordable Care Act until it could pass the Congress and the Senate. In describing these circumstances, Obama is somewhat critical of Republicans -- whose best interests are to block everything the Democrats do, no matter of the good that may come -- and leftist activists too, who blame the President for not going far enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality of being a politician is frustrating, and even as President you are driven by systems of power beyond your control. I was moved by one paragraph in particular where Obama explains his response to the 2010 oil spills caused by British Petroleum. After months of BP not being able to stop the leak, it had become a large-scale crisis affecting wildlife and humans in the Gulf coast -- the worst possible situation. The Federal government was starting to take blame for the crisis. Activists were complaining of their negligence; that despite the might of the largest US agencies, the oil leak inflicted continuous damage upon the Earth. Despite admitting fault publicly, Obama writes his silenced frustrations (page 571): "The only way to truly guarantee that we didn't have another catastrophic oil spill in the future was to stop drilling entirely; but that wasn't going to happen because at the end of the day, we Americans loved our cheap gas and big cars more than we cared about the environment, except when a complete disaster was staring at us in the face; and the absence of such a disaster, the media rarely covered efforts to shift America off fossil fuels or pass climate legislation, since actually educating the public on long-term energy policy would be boring and bad for ratings; and the one thing I could be certain of was that for all the outrage being expressed at the moment about the wetlands and the sea turtles and the pelicans, what the majority of us were really interested in was having the problem go away; for me to clean up yet another mess decades in the making with some quick and easy fix so we could all go back to our carbon spewing, energy wasting ways without having to feel guilty about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheesh! I was shook, reading that. It was a moment of pessimism, about the inevitability of human selfishness. But his warnings carry sway with the Coronavirus (now that the vaccine is widespread, who's talking about the root cause of the problem anymore?), or climate change (we really don't want to give up our gas-guzzling cars) or animal agriculture (slaughter-house footage is traumatic, but most of the time it's out of sight, out of mind). Even the President of the United States, with his platform built on "yes we can!", reminds us that the world sucks sometimes. It's difficult to make change, and sometimes people are too anxious to see beyond themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the President operates in a system, just like the rest of us. We can't expect one man to save America -- not if we're not doing the leg-work of shifting the hearts and minds of American people. Being a politician is, at its core, about making compromises and working with people whom you detest. Even those in the Democratic party are bound by their conservative constituents, or by campaign donations from Big Business. Sometimes, doing the right thing is political suicide. Though it may not be the President's job, there is still ample space to spread ideas about what ought to be. Artists, writers, activists and religious figures share values, inspire debate and bring new ideas to the table. At some point, those ideas are brought to the ugly floor of Congress and watered down and trampled on -- but at least they were there to start with.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This realization gives me a new perspective on how to judge politicians and people in general. For all the idealism someone might have, when they're put in a political bind or have to keep their job for their families, their values may be compromised. Politicians may talk the talk but we can't expect them to walk the walk because frankly, that doesn't poll well. Sometimes it's necessary to compromise something you believe for the sake of moving forward in the messy world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend Obama's autobiography. For aspiring politicians, and anyone who wants to be part of the ecology of change. It's a reminder that being President is just another job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/6169765906164055530/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2021/05/a-promised-land-by-barack-obama.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/6169765906164055530'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/6169765906164055530'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2021/05/a-promised-land-by-barack-obama.html' title='A Promised Land by Barack Obama'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-5088204817588930294</id><published>2021-04-14T17:48:00.006-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-14T17:53:39.545-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Ingrid Newkirk, head honcho of PETA</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Well, it's not everyday you chat with Ingrid Newkirk, head honcho of PETA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newkirk is somewhat of a legend in the animal rights movement. She started activism in the US in 1972 (three years before the publication of &lt;i&gt;Animal Liberation&lt;/i&gt;) working in Washington DC's dog adoption program, and founded PETA in 1980. She was one of the first abolitionists in America, going beyond "humane" treatment of animals and advocating an end to slaughter and commodification. Since 1980 PETA has grown to prominence, and, honestly, infamy. Most probably see them as animal loving buffoons, characterized by their stunts and inflammatory public statements about veganism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do think we have to give them credit. PETA's first laboratory investigation in 1981 found horrendous conditions of macaques in Silver Spring, Maryland; and the exposure almost directly led to the 1985 amendment on the Animal Welfare Act, protecting animals from excessive abuse in research. The prominence of "cruelty-free" labeling on cosmetics (like shampoos), though problematically wording, is largely there because of the public pressure PETA put on select companies, stigmatizing animal testing for unnecessary use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I think PETA has made mistakes in their struggle for animal liberation. Some have called the promotion of "cruelty-free" chocolate disingenuous, ignoring the labor struggles of cocoa production facilities in the Global South. Few can forget PETA's 2008 "Got autism" ad, which drew a tenuous link between dairy consumption and autism. There are numerous counts of objectification, fat-shaming of women's bodies, which I won't detail here. These instances make working with PETA... complicated. PETA has enough 
funding to run a super-bowl ad (and they have), higher over two hundred 
staffers, and have the most support for student activists out of other 
animal rights organizations. I want to build bridges and appreciate PETA's support, but how can I when they have made ads comparing mothers in the dairy industry to those at the US-Mexico border?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was pretty shocking in retrospect," said Newkirk about the. We spoke only 
through audio, but I could feel her head shaking. I was surprised -- 
everything I had heard from this fervent leader of PETA suggested she was obstinate in her beliefs. But despite everything -- we humble students had gotten on the phone with her. And she was listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our conversation centered on an internal controversy at PETA about Martin Luther King Day. An email thread was leaked online that featured staffers at PETA -- many of whom were people of color -- voicing concerns about PETA protesting for animals on this day, particularly without acknowledging racial justice. As I mentioned to Newkirk, this particular debate was not the crux of our concern. More pressing was the way that it was dealt with: Ingrid Newkirk, the director of PETA, shutting down voices of color in her own organization. It's unempowering for activists and harmful for the animal rights movement that &lt;i&gt;needs &lt;/i&gt;to have pluralistic support to achieve success. We also brought up the way that PETA's campaigns appropriating other movements are harmful in that same way -- alienating activists for social justice in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all the criticisms, we spoke to Newkirk as fellow animal liberationists. Peers in the struggle for animal rights, for a world free of suffering and domination of non-human creatures. I do have massive respect for Newkirk for shaping the American animal rights movement -- in fact, even more so after our conversation. In her memo to us after, she wrote, "I take on-board your comments about some of the gimmicks, if you will, we have used in the past, probably more out of desperation to get the AR message heard than anything. I'm sure we will inevitably, inadvertently misstep again, but it won't be for want of trying not to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe her. We all want PETA to be successful, and we all want students -- including students of color -- to be empowered in the movement. The animal rights movement is a small scene, and there's nothing to be gained from in-fighting. I know where she's coming from, and I know how hard and lonely it is advocating for animal liberation. By nature of existing in the burbling culture of Berkeley, I
 am always learning about the struggles of humans even in the United States -- but not everyone is. Whether it's police brutality, the threat of

full of systemic evils that people are working hard to address.

The way I was taught it, this Greek word describes something that is both a medicine &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;a poison at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is this possible? Well, as the German physician and philosopher Paracelsus says, "everything is a poison. The difference between a poison and a remedy depends on the dose." A notable example is Botox, a "therapy" that uses very mild doses of botulinum toxin to paralyze skin cells in one's face and prevent wrinkling. It's okay, though a little cringe-worthy, in small doses... but just ~2 nano-grams of botulinum toxin per kilogram of bodyweight is a lethal dose -- our system simply shuts down once exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pharmakon&lt;/i&gt; is also a term in philosophy, and for good reason. I can think of countless things that are both "remedies" for society, but also a potential source of toxicity. Consider: democracy prevents dictators from ruling forever, but also allowed the rise of populism and election of Donald Trump. Private pharmaceutical companies developed the Coronavirus vaccine extraordinarily quickly, but won't give fair prices to the Global South. Our phones allow unbelievable amounts of communication with people all around the world, but also can be addictive and fuel loneliness in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to deal with good and evil, but much harder to deal with &lt;i&gt;pharmakon&lt;/i&gt;. When new technologies come up, like wearable computers or immersive&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;video games, we have to watch out for the pitfalls and toxicity of it, even while recognizing the convenience and joy it may bring. That's really difficult sometimes, but necessary for living in this complicated world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/9122067770400248665/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2021/02/pharmakon-remedy-and-poison.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/9122067770400248665'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/9122067770400248665'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2021/02/pharmakon-remedy-and-poison.html' title='Pharmakon: Remedy and poison'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-1646622708952972528</id><published>2021-01-10T13:59:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2021-01-10T13:59:26.242-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>waitbutwhy career worksheet</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;priority rankings:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a fresh ranking, from first principles, based on who we really are. finding this out involves looking at my consciousness with a step back. one on side, I have the admirable values and wisdom I've accumulated that influences my priorities. On the other side, I have to accept I'm not a perfect utilitarian, saint, or money-making machine -- which involves self-compassion and acceptance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Non-negotiable (must have): Work-life balance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Top shelf (go hard at this): High impact, not sitting all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Middle shelf (don't fail at this): Money to get by and have savings, in places where i have friends, related to my passions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bottom shelf (great to have, not at the expense of others): travel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trash can (resist this): slave at something i don't care about, live in the same place my whole life, sit at a desk all day&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;getting to a place&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we have to look at career with a growth mindset! for something like being a surgeon, this is obvious -- you understand that even if you've never operated on someone before, you can be a surgeon at some point given effort and time. this is true, too, for other careers, like being an actor, author, or politician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the difference is that there's more dimensions. authors have to be good at writing, certainly. but also, public speaking, persistently pestering publications, personal branding, long-term devotion to a book, and more I think. And once you're good at all those things, it may still be a while till your books take off. Nonetheless, that's how it is for almost all authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urban suggests we consider Progress = Pace x Persistence. Pace depends on your work ethic and natural ability. The former can certainly be improved. Persistence is the long-term game -- pursuing your dream career for years and years, even after set-backs. A few years is not long enough -- you must dedicate a &lt;i&gt;lot &lt;/i&gt;of time to your passion to make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;the career game, understanding:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;the general landscape of all careers ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;specific game boards for careers i'm remotely interested in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;starting point in each one&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;success point -- where would I feel happy?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;my pace. How much work am I willing to put into these paths?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;my persistence. How much would I be willing to put into these paths?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis is very useful for distinguishing between careers. For instance, I'd love to be a public intellectual and speak about math, economics, and social justice -- but that very well might mean I have to get a PhD, suck up to professors, and grind for 6 years en route to that successful place. I may want to be a politician, but that means listening to wayyy too many people empathetically which is very difficult. If I want to be a writer, I know I've written a little bit already, but I haven't published in newspapers recently or anything. But I enjoy writing and I think I'm good at it, so maybe I have some inherent advantage. Then again, how long could I put up writing failed books? I'm not sure. On the other hand, working in alternative proteins is easier, because it pays money so I could certainly spend more time trying to become successful -- even as an entrepreneaur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;but really&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;test things out when you're looking at careers. you can't know if you'll get along with someone based on the tinder bio, and same with a career. start with small test-runs, decide what you like and don't like, and then test out something else. quit often, esp. when you feel like it. take on feedback, learn about the changing world.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/1646622708952972528'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/1646622708952972528'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-3077316879240472446</id><published>2021-01-04T06:47:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2021-01-04T06:47:03.584-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Ode to Buttercup</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strong-willed. Determined.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She carried these things around the house in her every step. Up the stairs, down the stairs, facing off against her mirrored self on the wall. Wandering into the garden, ignoring the gawking chickens, who were enamored by her, as we all are. She searched for those spots where no others dared to go, filling the darkest corners with light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9MzXRvGiijnT0yG2aeIfuWT4RxgSfhXu78dcLKORo056Ig1VzMmNeXWaukt7d1BcRP1mVxXqQZ4RZn86v3YjG4SDQyKcnDMKZPnyRCvIt4ZeM8qxwrnfYd0yfJz83yTExcQDzqa9VV3s/s1600/WhatsApp+Image+2021-01-04+at+06.43.45.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9MzXRvGiijnT0yG2aeIfuWT4RxgSfhXu78dcLKORo056Ig1VzMmNeXWaukt7d1BcRP1mVxXqQZ4RZn86v3YjG4SDQyKcnDMKZPnyRCvIt4ZeM8qxwrnfYd0yfJz83yTExcQDzqa9VV3s/s320/WhatsApp+Image+2021-01-04+at+06.43.45.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Graceful. Care-free. Friendly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pitter-patter of her footsteps is heard around the house. &lt;i&gt;Who's there?&lt;/i&gt; I ask, but she does not wait for permission to walk in. When lucky, she jumps onto my bed and stares thoughtfully out of the window. It's a big world out there. We bought some ringing toys for her to play with, and she claws at them playfully yet with certainty: &lt;i&gt;These are mine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;She loves being around people, but not &lt;i&gt;too &lt;/i&gt;close -- certainly not at first. Her carer tells me it comes from the fact that she was raised by dogs. She and her siblings were orphaned and then given to a momma dog who had still-born pups. Even after all these years she hasn't lost her adaptability and affectionate nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grass-loving. Charismatic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She loves plants. She'll eat anything she can get her paws on, so my succulent is moved to a safe place where she can't see. When she finds cat-nip (more accurately, non-verbally influences others to produce it for her), she eats it like Halloween candy: as fast as she possibly can, and with no regard for her health or savings. But we couldn't take the grass away from her -- that would crush her heart, and by extension, ours. She knows this. When she wants more she purrs at the door and looks up to the plants, and we do our best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boogers. Dignified.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes she has boogers on her nose. Housecats sometimes have this, especially when they are old and in a new environment, like she is. For a couple days I was tasked with wiping the boogers off her face. She was too dignified to let me, though, and pretended they weren't there, even if it meant sniffling all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seventeen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is seventeen years old. That's 84 in &lt;a href="https://www.almanac.com/cat-age-chart-cat-years-human-years"&gt;cat years&lt;/a&gt;. She has a tumor on her stomach -- it's a hard lump on her belly, but I try not to look because it reminds me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks with living with us, she loses her appetite. She withdraws to her room -- too tired for this house, too old for us. I know this, and I want the best for her, but all the same I don't want her to leave. We still keep cap-nip, just in case she wants some when she's up there. I hope she'll meet her adopted-mom, her cat-mom, and everyone else who loved her as much as she loved life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Buttercup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipp0LPp67HV1gkrYnYIcNZF_ML6V_S2l-8zGxdUhaFKglGbff3-2V0MVD5IqBNptLU4jtAv1R1GNkMC-PUblGvYD_Asz-XlUzfZNLkbRNcJVLNjCgcxsJzCu_D_JkTSjftT2Na4las48o/s1600/WhatsApp+Image+2021-01-03+at+16.29.55.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipp0LPp67HV1gkrYnYIcNZF_ML6V_S2l-8zGxdUhaFKglGbff3-2V0MVD5IqBNptLU4jtAv1R1GNkMC-PUblGvYD_Asz-XlUzfZNLkbRNcJVLNjCgcxsJzCu_D_JkTSjftT2Na4las48o/s320/WhatsApp+Image+2021-01-03+at+16.29.55.jpeg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Rohan Prasad, Jan 4th, 2020.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/3077316879240472446/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2021/01/ode-to-buttercup.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3077316879240472446'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/3077316879240472446'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2021/01/ode-to-buttercup.html' title='Ode to Buttercup'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9MzXRvGiijnT0yG2aeIfuWT4RxgSfhXu78dcLKORo056Ig1VzMmNeXWaukt7d1BcRP1mVxXqQZ4RZn86v3YjG4SDQyKcnDMKZPnyRCvIt4ZeM8qxwrnfYd0yfJz83yTExcQDzqa9VV3s/s72-c/WhatsApp+Image+2021-01-04+at+06.43.45.jpeg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-5284615085419897544</id><published>2020-12-28T14:45:00.003-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-28T14:45:24.040-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social change'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='personal'/><title type='text'>Cyborgs at the Harkness Table</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Here's a thought: Are English majors Cyborgs when they sit around a discussion table?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, what &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;a Cyborg? The word itself is a portmaneau of &lt;i&gt;cyber&lt;/i&gt;netic and &lt;i&gt;org&lt;/i&gt;anism -- a rough definition is "a person who is part machine, a robot who is part organic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would this relate to the Harkness Table? When we sit in a book club or English seminar, most people have their books open and mouths shut, save for a few rambling folk. The proud student flips through their book to cite page numbers, give exact quotes, and search for context when others are reading or analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we look at this a certain way, it becomes awfully cybernetic! After all, these people haven't &lt;i&gt;memorized &lt;/i&gt;the book, yet its physical existence allows students to recall quotes, plot-points, and metaphors after a bit of looking up. It may not seem so impressive, but this is a skill we (or at least some of us) build throughout high school so that we can have lovely, educated discussion. For the experienced reader, the book becomes an extension of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you might consider the book a &lt;i&gt;tool&lt;/i&gt;, whose use doesn't necessarily make us cybernetic. It's not &lt;i&gt;thinking &lt;/i&gt;for us -- it's just storing information. I mean, the use of pencils doesn't &lt;i&gt;scream &lt;/i&gt;Cyborg to me, nor does using flint and steel to light a fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when does that boundary stop? Is Google (or DuckDuckGo) also just a tool, since it only retrieves information? But then, what happens when you open Google Maps and it calculates an optimum route for you -- is it still just a storage device? That, along with many other examples (like Alexa, a FitBit, or even Elon Musk's Neuralink) make it more and more seamless to connect with new technologies (t's not unlike English class, when teenagers stealthily bring their phones out underneath the Harkness table!). In the language of computer science, the&lt;i&gt; bandwidth &lt;/i&gt;of information transfer is increasing so that we can connect with computers faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is rather scary. Being Cyborgs with great works of literature is fine -- I suppose -- but it beings nefarious when we think of Facebook, or Netflix, or Candycrush. But like it or not, these advances don't seem to be going away, and in fact people are getting more and more excited about them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my mind I try to remember to things when dealing with our increasingly Cyborked world: literacy and autonomy. The literacy movement -- giving the gift of 
reading to everyone -- is a noble one, and frankly essential for a 
democratic society. Our world is &lt;i&gt;built &lt;/i&gt;on reading, from court 
rulings to stop signs, and if only a few could actually do it we would 
revert to a feudal society. The same logic goes for technological 
literacy, like being able to write 
and read computer code. In addition, I'd say we need autonomy -- the 
ability to separate ourselves from our technological enhancements. For 
books, this is easy -- it's not hard to tell your teenager to put a book
 down. But when there's Facebook and Netflix and Candycrush on a kid's 
iPhone, they're are sucked in and are loathe to put away this "tool", 
which gives it power over us. Literacy alone doesn't cut it. We need 
space away from devices so that we have a better understanding of 
ourselves, don't get addicted to them, and of course have a bit of 
privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do you stop from becoming a Cyborg? Or is it something you whole-heartedly embrace?

It's hard for humans to understand exactly what went wrong -- something to do with partial derivatives, bush-funds, and the inter-galactic financial markets. Either way, the people of Krypton are in deep trouble, and after a meeting of the Council of the Olders, there's only one way out: the human blood trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those on Krypton send big fishing ships to Earth, lowering long cables to pick up humans stranded on the ground. Great care is put to ensure the humane and sustainable capture of those on earth. For instance, if the cables accidentally capture a pregnant women, she is plunged straight back into Earth's orbit so as not to affect the reproduction rate of our species. Those that are captured -- mostly males on the larger size -- are slaughtered via. harmless lethal injections, and their blood is sucked into vats that have the highest possible efficiency rate to prevent waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After just 300 hundred years, the harvesting of humans comes to an end. It was the fastest scaling and distribution of human blood in Krypton history. The Krypton economy is once more flourishing, and species conservationists rejoice that humans are still at a sustainable population (some, though, are kept in zoos to prevent complete extinction -- and so that younger generations can know the wonderful creatures that saved Krypton from annihilation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may recognize this story as that of the horseshoe crab, a salt water anthropod whose blood is in fact used for a variety of medical remedies for humans, &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/07/covid-vaccine-needs-horseshoe-crab-blood/"&gt;including the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/a&gt; However wise the Council of Olders, however sustainable the harvesting of humans, and however humane the treatment, most humans would reject the people of Krypton's use (or abuse) of humans. Their decisions -- though logical and self-interested -- are undemocratic and violate the inalienable rights we ought to possess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat of a super-human species exploiting our planet is -- believe it or not -- not just the concern of radical animal rights activists. This very issue animated Elon Musk to develop Neuralink -- an advanced brain machine interface which is, as he describes it, "a Fitbit for your brain." Musk believes that one day, there will come a time where computer intelligence has advanced so much that it exceeds our human capacities. If our treatment of non-human animals illustrates anything, it is that this will go very, very badly for us. The Neuralink devices, however repulsive, is one possible way that &lt;a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html"&gt;we &lt;i&gt;merge &lt;/i&gt;with super-human intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and hold it accountable to our rights and interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's another super-human specimen: Google. Facebook. PG&amp;amp;E, McDonald's, or Nestle. The corporation is in a way a cybernetic organism -- a collection of humans that do hundreds or millions of things at once, has enormous amounts of capital, and can lobby their way into government. Moreover, corporations can't be put into jail (only fined) even if they do violence upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to explore some questions in this blog-post, but to do so I need a few friendos: Monkeys, Sapiens, Corpus, Nation State, and the Terminator. These fine beings exist in the universe, whether we like it or not, and we need to find some way to make them get along. The problem is that they're each pretty selfish -- not unlike a monkey wanting their back scratched -- and when they want something, they do pretty nasty things to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the extended Great Chain of Being and the shenanigans therein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The characters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note living beings, legal fictions, information.

At least, I sure didn't. This time, our suffering has less to do with the strength of the virus and more to do with poor governance in supposedly advanced countries. It's rather shameful, really, but either way, the best thing we can do is sit at home and wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was walking to the test site and had some meandering thoughts that even if not too intelligent, stand as a record of this period in history:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;First I realized that interestingly, in these times we are guilty until proven innocent. Laws and social norms are really the same thing (to different extents) but under the Coronavirus judicial system, the rules are severe. Even before someone enters your house, we assume they have COVID (well, unless there's biological evidence otherwise!). Guilty until proven innocent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our friends at the CDC have used the famous number, R-naught (as did Boris Johnson when he issued his first plan for recovery), but maybe that's misleading. Another way to think about the spread of COVID is through networks. If you're 3 degrees of separation from someone who tested (ie. your father's sister's friend), what's the chance that you will, too? How many days will it take? The temporal aspect to networks isn't something we think about too often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put away your phone! I mean, I should, at least. We get so little human contact these days, so we may as well soak it in while we're out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does COVID change our quality of life? I mean for those still with food, water, and shelter, but stuck in our homes all day. How different is staring at a computer screen to going to a lecture and staring at a podium? Some would say that you can be happy anywhere, no matter the circumstances, if you have peace of mind. At the same time, lacking basic needs does make us less happy, and we don't see new people very often these days. But is Zoom a substitute for that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;COVID will probably be the next 9/11. We'll all remember where we were during the initial quarantine, though the stories to tell won't be &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;exciting. I imagine there'll come some time when people have forgotten about COVID-19 -- perhaps in 20, 30, or 50 years -- and us geezers will think, "ya'll are too young to remember the 2020 pandemic."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read about some protesters in Brazil marching for the climate and because their government had mishandled the virus. Now, I sure wish Americans and Brits had the guts to do that. But it's hard to voice political disagreement when there's a virus. It's a unique state of emergency where the very act of gathering (normally protected via. Freedom of Speech) is pretty taboo. Also, with something like a pandemic (and many other emergencies) the knowledge / expertise is concentrated in the hands of "professionals", who normally don't go about getting arrested for political causes. So people protesting must first educate themselves on the science of the issue, then understand the politics of the situation, &lt;i&gt;then &lt;/i&gt;take action. That's a high bar!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As Jason Hickel commented in a recent Tweet (as did Kim Stanley Robinson in his podcast with Ezra Klein), the Coronavirus is a glimpse into capitalism's response to a crisis. In other words, pathetic. Both the coronavirus and the climate crisis are transnational, demand a socialized economy, and though devastating act through slow violence. We need to prepare ourselves for the next crisis after COVID, and the work begins now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/4258783267890892464/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/12/7-reflections-on-covid.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4258783267890892464'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/4258783267890892464'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/12/7-reflections-on-covid.html' title='7 Reflections on COVID '/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-416755548591990307</id><published>2020-11-25T20:46:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2020-11-25T20:46:37.224-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In this part of the world, rocks look like the molars of giants. They are two storeys tall and must have fallen from the sky. At day, we walk along the gums of these stony fellows; at night, we eat &lt;i&gt;zacusca de casa &lt;/i&gt;-- the Romanian spread pronounced with an Italian accent -- with sour dough. We cook canned lentil soup on the stove till the propane runs out, then we retreat into our canvass-based tent cabin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trevor Noah says in one skit, "camping? I ain't going camping. I left South Africa &lt;i&gt;so I wouldn't go camping&lt;/i&gt; -- no, I don't wanna sleep under the stars!".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, myself and two friends went camping last weekend. We came equipped with a "four season tent", food for the three of us, and the sense of adventure to top it off. Here's my take, though. Camping isn't really about the material reality of sleeping in a pile of canvass or the long walks you might take in the day. To me, it's about simplicity. The mere fact that you &lt;i&gt;can &lt;/i&gt;get by with so little. That the "wild" isn't so unwelcoming once you've slept by its streams and ascended mountains in the valley and cooked food by a measly morning fire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinnacles National Park is equipped with massive boulders, narrow ledges, and a whole bunch of tourists navigating the rocky terrain. Everyone wants to be like Indiana Jones, and seeing the rocks makes me regret not bringing my lasso from home. We wandered around the park both with a map and rather aimlessly. There was no timeline nor agenda -- only the ~8 mile rim trail that encircles the beauty of the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day, I could feel the mental baggage from everyday life. Worries and stresses weighed me down, racing through my mind so frequently even though now, I can't recall what was so urgent at the time. Unsurprisingly my presence, awareness and appreciation was affected. It only took a couple hours for me to be crying for Oreo soy-milk-shakes and some almond milk chocolate (none of that was available at the campsite).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly, though, after a good night's sleep and the chance to soak in the setting, my mind began to clear. Before dinner, my belly hungry for nutrients, I took a slow walk to see the cabin-tents and RV's that flickers of life inside them. The setup on some RV's astounded me. They seemed largely used by old white men (like Grandpa in Ben 10), which I think is a fair hobby if you're in that state. The air that night was fresh and cold enough that it tingled my nostrils, a feeling I savored and had me walk back to the fire. &lt;i&gt;No thoughts, head empty &lt;/i&gt;-- a quote I had seen before -- rang in my mind. In the middle of Pinnacles National Park that night, there was nothing to do but &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;exist&lt;/i&gt;, and breath life in like that evening air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following day we hiked some more. We talked more. We saw sight and climbed mountains and rocks and skirted around the parke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;rocks are teeth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zacusca de Casa, Romanian w/ Italian accent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;military base&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;off-roading with the surrey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;applying rawl's basic structure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;trump protesters and anti-protesters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;camping, no propane, fancy meals and shanty meals. appoi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;no thoughts, head empty rings as my to-do list floats out of mind&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sketchy rocks, listening to chinese waiting for the electrical vehicle to arrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;getting out makes you remember why home is home. a bed. food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;life is a marathon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;basics are all we need, and in many ways all we have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;experience &amp;gt; things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/11/zacusca%20de%20casca.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/416755548591990307'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/416755548591990307'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-7794753378311673498</id><published>2020-10-08T00:38:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2020-10-08T00:38:31.752-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Do it yourself</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In the fourth grade I made my own Halloween costume: a garbage bag. That was how some saw it, at least. I'm not sure what I had in my head -- perhaps a paper warrior, or a recycling king? Either way, to make it I cut out a brown lunch bag as a helmet, taped an array of A4 sheets on my back, and held a long cardboard roll as a staff to parade around the streets of St. John's Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an (albeit disappointing) example of what a Do It Yourself (DIY) attitude can produce. Others include &lt;a href="https://www.completefoods.co/"&gt;DIY Soylent&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/"&gt;GNU Linux&lt;/a&gt; operating system, and Mahatma Gandhi's &lt;a href="https://www.mkgandhi.org/swadeshi_khadi/whatiskhadi.htm"&gt;&lt;i&gt;khadi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In short, works of utmost beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may laugh -- because we all know that isn't quite true. Linux isn't quite as smooth as Mac OS, and any Indian liberationist would acknowledge Gandhi could've been better dressed. The point of DIY, however, isn't perfection. It's the autonomy, mastery, and ownership you have over the final product. When I made that Halloween costume in fourth grade, people laughed at me, and it had some flaws. But it was mine, and no one could take that away*.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately this ethic is not just another one of my crack-pot ideas. The feelings brewing in my pre-adolescent youth have been codified in the &lt;i&gt;Repair Manifesto&lt;/i&gt;, which I recently saw on my landlord's shed. "We hold these truths to be self-evident," it begins. "If you can't fix it, you don't own it."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="iFixit's self-repair manifesto" height="448" id="manifestoImage" src="https://d1ulmmr4d4i8j4.cloudfront.net/static/images/manifesto/manifesto_en_final.jpg" width="373" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I confess this &lt;i&gt;Manifesto &lt;/i&gt;mentions many things I was not completely conscious of when I assembled my "garbage bag" costume. When we repair any type of gadget or doohickey, the benefit for the earth is three-fold: you don't throw out the gadget you have, you save on the materials needed to create another gadget, and you don't produce wasteful by-products created through the gadget's supply chain. Of course, over time you also save money (I've found this to be true after I started cutting my own hair), you gain independence from industries, and you learn some engineering skills you can easily practice in the future.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now, you're probably sold, so let me take this a little further. What if the &lt;i&gt;Do It Yourself &lt;/i&gt;attitude was carried through everything: our homes, our streets, our politics. If you don't like what your local Mayor or Councilmember is doing, &lt;i&gt;do it yourself!&lt;/i&gt; If you don't like how your trash is being taken out, &lt;i&gt;do it yourself!&lt;/i&gt; If you don't like how the dishes are being done, &lt;i&gt;do it yourself!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this mantra asks a lot of you. But there's a lot to fix in this day and age -- and we need &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;to take up the wrench and make things better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;* My DIY ethic for Halloween costumes -- you may be pleased to know -- has continued past lower school. In tenth grade I dressed up as my physics teacher and won the "scariest costume prize" in the high school; in freshmen year of college I did a similar impersonation of my math professor (for that, no prize was received except a confused expression on his face.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/7794753378311673498/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/10/do-it-yourself.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7794753378311673498'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7794753378311673498'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/10/do-it-yourself.html' title='Do it yourself'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-7838888044276314659</id><published>2020-09-30T12:57:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2020-12-27T11:41:26.673-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='personal'/><title type='text'>A river</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I wrote a blog post. About a month, one might say. Though I can pin that answer down via the Gregorian calendar, I'm not so sure. Is time really like a ruler, where you can measure it from end to end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe time grows like a tree, where every moment stretches as the tree grows older and older. Or maybe time flows like a river, speeding down some stretches and slowing at the curves and bends. Somehow this rings more true, to me. During this time -- this day, this month, this year -- time flows in a remarkable way. The pandemic makes things feel strange, like time has warbles and hiccups along it's long arrow. Sometimes I don't believe I'm in this time, or that looking back I was in the time of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of doing "polyphasic sleeping", which is a method where you sleep very little at night and take frequent naps during the day. Naps energize you dramatically and &lt;i&gt;time-&lt;/i&gt;efficiently, so overall you spend less time sleeping and more time doing other things. I told this to some people in a moment of excitement -- imagine all the time I was going to save! As if time were like gold coins that you can spend and save and waste. If time is like a river then I don't know if that all makes sense. Just as water flows down the river, water falls from the sky and replenishes the reserves in the mountain. You can't do that with gold coins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I wrote a blog post.

“EECS Industrial Partners”&lt;a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and have special access to recruit budding computer scientists
studying at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
	As the students protested, they chanted phrases like “Up up
liberation, down down with deportation.” and “Carol Christ, you
know it’s true, the crimes of ICE depend on you.” These
statements reference Palantir’s connections to the Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, which uses Palantir’s tools to
access and surveil people’s data in real time to hound undocumented
immigrants. Palantir’s tools are a hallmark of the post-9/11,
digital age – an example of big data giving unprecedented power to
the US surveillance state.&lt;/p&gt;

	This essay will focus on the &lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;socio-technical
imaginaries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;espoused
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;by the students &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;compared
to that of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Berkeley’s EECS
department. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;A socio-technical
is defined as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;a way “with
which individuals and collectives imagine and build their desired
futures.”&lt;a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;For this specific case, this
paper will describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; the EECS
department’s vision of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;providing
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;an impartial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;platform
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;for private companies, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;compared
to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;students’ vision of
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;hosting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;only
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;moral and ethical
institutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Such
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;visions get to the heart of
data and society: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;To what
ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;data science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
used – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;when
something goes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; wrong, who
should speak against it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;First,
one can examine the supposedly neutral &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;role
that Palantir and Berkeley play in ICE’s doings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Palantir
has largely &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;abstained from
moral responsibility for ICE’s immigrant abuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;They have claimed that though
they provide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
tools, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;they are not
responsibles for the actions of the clients or the way that they are
used.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;The
EECS department, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;too, refused
any moral responsibility in connecting with Palantir. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
professors said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; tha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;t
the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;University is not
endorsing ICE, but merely providing a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;platform &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;for
free engagement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daily
California &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;quotes, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;CAP
should be a platform in which students and employees can freely
interact.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;From this
perspective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;the
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;obligation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;to oppose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
wrong-doing falls on Berkeley &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;students &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;rather
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;than the EECS department&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;absolving the University of
responsibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;However
one considers the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;CAP
program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;the
professors’ statements ignore a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;deeper,
incestual bonding between Big Tech and academia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Rodrigo
Ochigame, in an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Intercept
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;article
called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;The
Invention of ‘Ethical AI’, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;describes
how the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;academic
world &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;endorses
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;and
legitimizes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;the
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;ethics-washing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
of Big Tech&lt;a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;More
and more activists have been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;opposing
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;practices
of the industry &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;with
movements like #NoTechForIce or #Data4BlackLives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;),
and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
in response &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;the
Tech &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Industry
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;has
had a surge of conferences on ethics and humane use of technology.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;This
too is a conflict of socio-technical imaginaries – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;is
technology held accountable through public means &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;or
through self-regulation? As Ochigame describes, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Tech
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;ndustry
wants to regulate itself, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;and
universities like MIT or Berkeley provide space and credibility for
this socio-political imaginary (Berkeley’s own Division of Data
Sciences is led by a Microsoft veteran, Ochigame notes). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Having
considered the EECS department&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;examine
the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;socio-technical
imaginary of the students in their protest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;The
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;students’
chants &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;including&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Carol
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Christ,
you know it’s true, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;the
crimes of ICE depend of you” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;ethically
implicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
the University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;They
assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
that b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;y
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;providing
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;s
to Palantir, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;the
UC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;perpetuate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
the system of violence, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;even
if they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;are
not directly causing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;deportation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;possibly
in response to this argument, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;UC
Berkeley has since &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;removed
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Palantir
from the list of Industrial Partners). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;They
claim that a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
public institution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;ought
not to endorse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;nefarious

entity – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;especially
one that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;enables
violence &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;and
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;terror
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;on

may even be students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;).
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Thus,
the imaginary is that data science companies ought to be constrained
by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;morality
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;laid
out by the people, not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;by

– the academic and the political – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;each

Back then the world is
in chaos, and now it still is. The Coronavirus was looming. My
university had just been closed for the rest of the semester.
California was about to enter an emergency lockdown, as if there were
some terrorist threat. Presidents, Chancellors, and Prime Ministers
were on TV, throwing about words like “global pandemic” “public
health crisis” “social distancing.” I didn’t know what would
happen – would I even be able to board my flight? Would police
shoot anyone walking on the streets? How long would this thing last?
In that terror I walked onto a largely empty plane, masked up and
wary of what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;
	Now I’m back on board United Airlines. The uncertainty that
permeated the air five months ago has mostly calloused into a bleak
outlook for the next few months, especially in the United States.
Millions have lost their jobs, hundreds of thousands have lost their
lives, and countless industries are scarred by this nuisance of a
virus. Then there’s my comparatively small disappointment: the
University of California, Berkeley has canceled in-person classes.
There won’t be anyone hurrying from class to class on campus –
there won’t even be many students in Berkeley – for all of this
semester and possibly through the following Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;
	The Coronavirus is an invisible demon… but I suppose those are the
worst types. You can’t see it, but you can see the havoc it reigns
upon us: scarred lungs, high temperatures, and a death threat.
Somehow one strand of RNA has uprooted the lives of every&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;human
on earth – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;how is that even
possible?? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I’m not sure
I’ll ever get over it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;The
world is a bizarre place, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;in
all honesty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Despite online
classes I’m still going to Berkeley to study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;And
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I’m going there by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;flying
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;humongous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;hunk of metal with wings.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;When I stop to think about
it,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;t’s
miraculous that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; I’m &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
breathing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;thousands of feet
off the ground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;In
some sense &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;the Coronavirus
has made us reckon with our old selves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Our
world is bizarre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I
ought to count my blessings that I live here, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;not
anywhere else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Think
about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;creators
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;spiritual
or mechanical, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;whichever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
you like) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;invented&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
things like flying machines, automated vehicles, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;and
a world-wide web of information… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;They
must’ve been so proud, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;and
imagined how happy people would be after &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;their
invention was widely distributed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;What
would they say to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;lol &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;cats,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;COVI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;D
trips to Hawaii or Formula One?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Nevertheless
the world changes fast. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;A
year ago if I read this very essay, I would&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;n’t
at all believe it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;oh,
such an innocent time. Is there&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
way to go back?). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;In other
ways, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I guess the world
doesn’t really change at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Throughout
our history &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;there’s always
been the “arrogance of man” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;as
well as natural disasters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;to
put us in our place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;There’s
always &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;selfish
people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;who make things worse,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;and good people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;who try to make things
better. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I guess &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;this
is another one of those situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I,
and I’m sure many others, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;wish
they had behaved differently before COVID-19… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
I mean, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;this is the situation
and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;it’s all we’ve got.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;Maybe if I resign myself to
this, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I’ll be liberated
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;from the thoughts of “what
if… what if...” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;One day I
know the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;world &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;will
return &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;to normal, but until
then &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;I think I’ll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;enjoy life as best I can.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/i&gt;tells of a Asiatic, fantasy world with four great nations: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation and the Air Nomads. Some people in those nations can bend the elements, using their powers for good or evil. A hundred years before the show's beginning, the Fire Nation declared war on the others and are about to finish what they started. Only the Avatar can unite all four elements and bring balance to the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;is a kids' show, but it's not &lt;i&gt;just &lt;/i&gt;a kids' show. It's a cinematic master-piece, with hand-drawn animation and deep references to East Asian religions and martial arts. It has a story that will blow you away. It tells of balance &amp;amp; destiny, loss &amp;amp; family, changing cultures, coming of age, and peace &amp;amp; violence. Those are the themes, at least, that I will discuss here... but watching it brought about far more inspiration than I can discuss in a blog-post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I urge you to watch this show. After this introduction, I'll be assuming you have... Don't worry -- you can always read my blog later. But &lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;cannot wait -- the fate of the world lies in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Balance &amp;amp; Destiny&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days -- a time of peace... When the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;-- Katara, Book 1: Ep. 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Balance and Destiny are key elements of the &lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;story. These elements that make it a legend, rather than just an animation, in that they make the action and the cultures portrayed in a spiritual context.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First off, there's balance. The idea of balance probably comes from Taoism. In Taoism, there is the Yin and the Yang which represents the sun and moon or male and female. Yin and Yang is referenced directly In Book 1 Ep. 20, when the moon spirit comes down from the spirit world and takes the form of a fish -- the balance is threatened when Commander Zhao captures the Moon spirit. At other times, the characters must balance the rage of warring nations, the home of spirits with fast-paced industrialization, and the elements too: fire, earth, wind, and water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In regards to the elements, the Fire Nation is a grand force that pushed them out of balanced. They started the war with Sozin's Comet, an astrological moment that gave them enough power to slaughter the monks of Aang's childhood. In these moments of destruction, the Fire Nation forgot about the balance in the world. They became consumed by their greed, and did not balance pride with compassion. They became a more powerful nation but lost a sense of themselves: their cultures, traditions, and &lt;i&gt;life&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We can learn from the Fire Nation's mistake in the non-Avatar world. Here, we must balance our desires for money with our friendships; our ego with our humility; our work and our life. Wiser people than me have thought of this, so it's better to read about Taoism and the other traditions referenced in &lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;before making claims. However, I do think that the lessons about &lt;i&gt;balance &lt;/i&gt;that the &lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;seeks to create are relevant to us, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, destiny. Take Prince Zuko, a character whose destiny&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is split. His great-grandfather is Fire Lord Sozin, the one who started the war. But his other great-grandfather is Avatar Roku, whose reincarnation is meant to restore balance to the nations. Poor Zuko's life is in turmoil because of actions of his fore-fathers, and no real fault of himself. This is a theme in the novel, with characters being thrust into situations or duties that they did not ask for. Zuko spends much of&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the series&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;searching his soul and trying to understand his true destiny -- though this causes great anguish (much like real life: it is never easy to go against a path set by your family). His half-scarred face represents his split heritage and his undecided destiny: one side cursed but longing for the Fire Lord's acceptance, the other side open to the creation of a new world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aang, too, is burdened with responsibilities that he didn't ask for. Everyone expects him to "bring balance to the world," because that is what the Avatar has done for centuries. Aang is only a twelve-year-old kid, but he takes on this responsibility with great diligence. He has no other choice, after all -- if that is what the Avatar has done for 10,000 years, who is he to stray from that path? That sense of destiny is what gives the series intense weight, because the balance of the elements lies on the protagonists' shoulders. It's also what gives us confidence in the characters, because we know that with destiny on their side, they cannot fail. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, "the arc of history bends toward justice."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it is not easy to bring balance to the world. It is not done by winning one battle, jailing on bad person, or learning one element. Destiny -- our duty to the world -- takes a life of perseverance, reflection, and commitment. With patience (and some story-telling), Aang is able to bring balance to two warring tribes (Book 1: Ep. 11). With reflection, Aang is able to unlock his seven chakras (Book 2: Ep. 20). And with commitment, he and his friends are able to defeat the Fire Lord and his armies, when all other hopes were lost (Book 3: Ep. 20).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the characters in &lt;i&gt;Avatar&lt;/i&gt;, it was never easy to discover their destiny, or bring balance to a world in such disarray. Goodness is never easily won. And yet, they did it. In &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; world that's full of evils like inequality and greed, I believe it is our destiny to restore balance in any way we can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Loss &amp;amp; Family&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Leaves on the vine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Falling so slow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Like fragile tiny shells&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Drifting in the foam&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Little soldier boy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Come marching home&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Brave soldier boy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Comes marching home&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So sings Uncle Iroh on the birthday of his lost son, Lu Ten. Iroh transformed when he lost his son. He went from being a fiercesome general -- the Dragon of the West -- to the kind old man who loved and mentored all. In his vignette in &lt;i&gt;Tales of Ba Sing Se&lt;/i&gt;, we focus on the loss he faced in this long war. Lu Ten, in a way, symbolises the countless nameless, faceless soldiers that die in great battles. As tears flow from Iroh's face, and his voice cracks singing his lullaby, we can sense some of the magnitude of his loss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Loss shaped him to be the kind soul he is, and so too did it shape Katara, daughter of Kya. Because her mother died, and her father went off to war, Katara assumes the role of a mature, responsible adult in the Southern Water Tribe. Like many others in the story, she is unwillingly thrust into adulthood because of violence a loss that occured early in life. Katara performs this role so well, but this tragedy had lasting impacts on her, too. She is as fierce as she is kind when confronted with the man who murdered her mother in the name of the Fire Nation, even using blood-bending on a suspect. Despite her ferocity, Katara has suffered tragedies. When she cries out for her dad -- pleading him and Aang not to abandon her (Book 3: Ep.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;2)&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;-- it becomes clear that she &lt;i&gt;has &lt;/i&gt;been deeply affected by losing loved ones. Part of her is still the young girl who cried out for her lost mother, and would do anything to get her back. In part, this drives her to strike out against the Fire Nation and have hope in the Avatar. But in her water-bending prowess and vast accomplishments, her loss is never forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, Zuko and Azula also face loss; not from the death of their parents, but by their rejection. Zuko is unloved and disregarded by Ozai, his cruel father. But even after banishment, a lifelong scar, and humiliation, Zuko still craves Ozai's approval. I think this shows the way that family shaped Zuko, even with all that he went through. Raised in the Fire Nation palace, loved by his mother and admiring his father, Zuko couldn't help but dream to be accepted by the Fire Nation and aspire to become Fire Lord. Azula, too, was born into a war-hungry, violent family. Her mother, Ursa, deemed her monstrous, which led to an exaggeration of that trait and a reluctance to grow close to anyone. Azula, like her fore-fathers in the Imperialist Fire Nation, seeks power and victory -- not balance or friendship -- as her teenage dream. And when this is torn from her by Zuko, and when her friends also turn on her, she is abandoned in her own mental torture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's important that &lt;i&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/i&gt;deals with loss. It shapes the characters in ways that I can only attempt to understand. That is the legacy of war: not victory or conquest, but unimaginable grief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Changing cultures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Few children's shows deal with genocide, but &lt;i&gt;Avatar&lt;/i&gt; tackles the topic bravely. While Aang was in the iceberg, the Fire Nation went to each Air Temple and killed the Air Nomads -- the monks, children, and venerable teachers that Aang knew and loved (including Monk Gyatso, Aang's tutor and advocate). Aang comes to know this suddenly in Book 1: Ep. 3, when he sees the remains of the Southern Air Temple. He is driven to the &lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;state, searching for vengeance on those who destroyed his family. How can it be, to be the sole survivor of a genocide? To be the last air-bender? How large was his guilt at being absent when the genocide happened?
 (Book 1: Ep. 12)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This guilt becomes anger when Aang finds out that the Northern&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Air Temple has been remade by a steam-punk group with engineered gliders (Book 1, Chap. 17). At first, Aang hates the idea of his spiritual home being used for this new purpose. His conservatism is understandable. How can these people change a culture that is on the brink of extinction? The engineers knew little of the Air Nomads, and still took over the sacred temple with no authority to do so. Eventually, Aang accepts what has happened to the temple. He understands that the engineers need a place to live, and have tried their best to imitate some Air Nomad traditions without the powers of bending. Nonetheless, it is important to give respect to communities and traditions we have built from, and respect their soveirgnity in the modernized world.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
As a migrant through time, Aang also experiences the change in the Fire Nation after they became an Imperialist power. In Book 3: Ep. 2, Aang goes to Fire Nation school, and learns about the false history they tell in annihilating the Air Nomad's army (in reality, the Air Nomads were monks and had no military force). Later in that episode, he teaches his schoolmates the bright and lively dances of the old Fire Nation, letting them loose and liberating them from the oppressive education system that resembles Victorian England. Their students are brought up to be soldiers and despise the other three great civilizations.  This education system was really interesting to me -- it shows not only have the Fire Nation oppressed others, they have repressed their own fluorishing, creative culture. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Fire Nation twists their cultures in more ways than one. Prince Zuko loses his ability to fire-bend when he lets go his hatred for Aang. Previously, that hatred was what gave him -- and all other fire-benders -- the power to bend. So Aang and Zuko seek to re-learn fire-bending (Book 3, Ep. 12). They find the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Sun Warriors&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and meet the last Dragons: Ran and Shaw. The Dragons take the Chinese form, with long bodies and noble whiskers, rather than the Westernized dragons seen in most American media. Ran and Shaw&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;teach Aang and Zuko the origins of fire-bending: an art with beauty and life, rather than hate and aggression. With this, Zuko's fire-bending becomes stronger than before, and more in line with the original teachers. This story is yet another example of how the Fire Nation transformed their culture, leading with fear and oppression rather than its noble origins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(there's also Avatar Day, where an Earth Nation town burns statues of the Avatars in retaliation of a former leader. This town ends up honoring Aang for saving them. This is an example of how great figures like the Avatar can change cultures).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cultures change constantly in our lives. Some of that can be good, but it's worth considering when it's not. In &lt;i&gt;Avatar&lt;/i&gt;, cultures change mostly from war and conflict. In particular, this changes the fabric of the Fire Nation. Everyone born in such a culture becomes someone they are not meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Coming of age&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the main characters in &lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;are kids, and thus we see remarkable growth and maturity throughout the course of the series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Take Prince Zuko, a banished teenager struggling to regain his honor. He starts out angry and obsessed with hunting the Avatar. Zuko is powerful, but harbors resentment to Azula and Ozai, feeling ostracized and desperate to prove his worth. Eventually, when Zuko &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;accepted by his father and has everything he had ever wanted, he realizes that it is not the right path for him. His Uncle was right -- he realizes -- and Zuko decides that to be his own man, he must forge his own destiny. With this resolve Zuko confronts his father and helps Aang bring balance to the Four Nations, playing a essential role in ending the war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Saaka, too, is a character that grows from a Southern Water Tribe boy. He starts out cocky, ordering about the little kids in his village, but his humbled as he sees the Kyoshi Warriors and his element-bending friends. He loses a girl he loves to the heavens, and fights endlessly to save Suki from danger (not that she needed saving, anyways). His growth cumulates in Book 3, Ep. 4&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;when he learns the Way of the Sword from Pian Dao. He spends hours painting, practicing, and meditating under this master. Such obedience would offend the proud water tribe boy, but Saaka takes it with stride. It pays off, too, as his swords-master challenges him to a duel and Saaka practically wins. His ingenuity and courage is tested many times in the series, but every time Saaka asserts himself as a valuable member of Team Avatar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aang, of course, bears the burden of being the Avatar. A hundred years ago, before the Fire Nation sparked destruction, Aang's destiny drove him to run away from the Air Nomads. He was caught in a storm of despair and longing for his old childhood (Book 1: Ep. 12). In the series, he realizes that a lot rests on his shoulders. Defeating the Fire Lord was never going to be an easy task. However, Aang's mentors help him in facing this massive challenge. Avatar Roku helps him learn the history of the Avatar and the Fire Lord&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(Book 3: Ep. 6), and the powers and peril of the Avatar State. Iroh hears Aang's desperation and advises that: "sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always seee the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving, you will come to a better place." (Book 3: Ch. 19). Toph teaches Aang the strength of will and solidity that lets him become an earth-bender. Katara and Zuko teach him how to bend water and fire. And Guru Pathik helps Aang unlock his seven chakras and be free from his material possessions. These mentors help Aang face the challenges of his burdened life, a necessary component of coming of age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aang's friends help him too -- especially his budding romance with Katara. Katara offers immense emotional support to Aang, helping him bear the burden of the Hundred Years War. Only Katara can coax Aang out of the Avatar State, brought by the fury at losing Appa or his Air Nomad brethren. And Katara always believes in Aang, since the very beginning of opening sequence.&lt;br /&gt;
In some ways it is natural that Aang falls in love with Katara, but in other ways it's odd because of the motherly, care-taking role that she plays in his life (Aang and Toph may have been a better choice). Nonetheless, their romance cements the support that they have for each other, a heart-warming consequence of the journey they went through.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's nice to read coming of age stories. It makes young children think about their experiences and what kind of person they want to become. And it makes old people like me reflect on our adolescence and what shaped us. In &lt;i&gt;Avatar&lt;/i&gt;, we see the importance of mentors, friendships, and self-determination in making us the people we want to be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Peace and Violence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"You were right about what Katara needed. Violence wasn't the answer... But I have a question for you -- what are you gonna do when you face my father?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;-- Prince Zuko, Book 3: Ep. 14&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The interplay of peace and violence is central to the Avatar narrative. Violence is the flame that starts conflict or a transformation... until peace is called to calm the storm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consider Zuko's journey of banishment and eventual re-claiming of the Fire Lord. His journey starts with a violent tradition: the Agni Kai. This duel against his father is what scarred him, and marked his destiny to hunt the Avatar during his banishment. And, indeed, his "treason" was protesting a Fire Nation general's decision to send innocent soldiers to die in battle. In both causes, Zuko fought violence with non-violence -- maintaining his honor and showing his true self. When Zuko faces Azula in the Book 3 Finale, he must return to the violent tradition of the Agni Kai. This time, he wins, having knowledge of original fire benders, but he does not scar Azula in the same way his father scarred him. He uses violence as a means to achieving peace. And further, he risks his own life to save Katara, another selfless act that solidifies his position as a peaceful Fire Lord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Iroh's transformation, too, is one from violence to peace. We see Iroh as a laid-back, tea-loving Uncle in the beginning of the series. Later, however, we find out his bloody past: his ferocity in battle, his laughter at the siege of Ba Sing Se. His culture -- which Zuko shared -- is one that valorizes violence and the destruction of others, and so it is natural for him to have these traits from being born into it. However, as mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Loss &amp;amp; Family,&lt;/i&gt; the death of Iroh's son is what drives Iroh to become a peaceful man. He treats all people, no matter their nationality, as friends. He allows himself to go to Fire Nation prison to save Aang and his friends. The peace and self-sacrifice with which Iroh carries himself is the epitome of non-violence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another character that battles with violence is Katara. Her commitment to non-violence is tested when Zuko helps her find the man who murdered her mother (Book 3: Ep. 14). (Katara's mother, Kya, sacrified herself by saying she was a water bender. Another example of self-sacrifice to protect others). Katara now has power over the man who kill her mother, but decides -- with Aang's encouragement -- to forgive him, rather than take vengeance. She realizes that killing a man will not bring back 
her mother or her childhood -- it will only continue the cycle of 
violence. As Aang says, doing nothing is easy, but forgiving is hard. Thus the path to peace tests Katara in a way that no battle could. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aang and the Air Nomads are of course, non-violent till the end. 
Aang takes immense care of Appa and Momo, treating them like family even in the toughest conditions. When Appa is lost in Book 2, Aang cries and searches far and wide to find him again. Aang and the other Air Nomads are also devout vegetarians, showing their peaceful devotion to non-human animals and nature. And in battle, Aang avoids hurting his opponents. He dodges attacks thrown at him, and avoids striking by carefully tying up or otherwise incapacitating his opponents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fate of Fire Lord Ozai is the ultimate test of Aang's non-violence. How will he treat this man -- the descendent of the people who murdered his people? A man with plans to wipe out the entire Earth Nation? Aang asks the Avatars of the past, who tell him time and time again to "be decisive" and "finish" the Fire Lord. This answer was not satisfactory for Aang. He searches his heart and the lineage of the Avatars and finds an answer: energy-bending. Instead of killing Ozai, Aang takes his fire-bending powers away from him. He ends this bloody war without a single needless death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You probably know why I like &lt;i&gt;Avatar&lt;/i&gt; so much. There's so much to unpack, and my blog-post only scratched the surface (some other themes: friendship, resistance, gender empowerment). Each episode has it's own story, beautifully wrapped in a 25-minute ball of goodness. The epic-ness of the saga parallels &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Eragon&lt;/i&gt; -- the last two of which shaped my childhood in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think &lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;is a powerful example of how fiction can really make a difference. The lessons we learn from Aang, Katara, Zuko or Iroh inspire us to be better people and bring balance to our own lives in any way we can.&lt;br /&gt;

I feel really grateful that the show exists, and that so many talented people put time into writing, story-boarding, animating, music-ing, sound-tracking, and spreading the message to kids and adults across the world.

People who float like bubbles over the concerns that plague others. People who bounce back from adversity like a ball of elastics, ready to get up, stretch, and tackle another day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think we should have more respect for these people. After all, we have lists of the ten richest men, women, countries and cities. But what about the happiest people? Where's their medal of honor?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of the problem is that you can't compare happiness in the same way you can compare money. Still, though, we can at least look at people close to us. Who seems like they're in a reasonably pleasant mood, most of the time? That's not too hard to figure out. And better yet, we can look at ourselves. Am I happy right now? How about yesterday? Maybe I should check again tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wonder if we had a world based on happiness, how economics would change. Maybe there'd be people betting on the happiness of firms, and whether they'll go up or down in the coming months. Maybe we would trade stories and experiences, rather than material things. Maybe we'd choose our majors, jobs, and past-times not on what impresses others, but what really makes us feel like life's worth living (of course, you have to put the bread on the table, too).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm really repeating things that others have very eloquently said. My professor Clair Brown wrote a book on &lt;a href="https://buddhisteconomics.net/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Buddhist Economics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which deals with the economics of happiness, sustainability, and shared prosperity. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report"&gt;World Happiness Report&lt;/a&gt; is published by the UN each year (it would lovely if more analysis were done on this report, rather than monetary measures). And the reason I'm thinking about this at all is because I'm taking a course at the Greater Good Science Center about the &lt;a href="https://www.edx.org/course/the-science-of-happiness-3"&gt;Science of Happiness&lt;/a&gt;, which I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like money, happiness is something we have to work towards. Just because someone's rich or lives in an industrialized nation doesn't mean they're automatically cheerful all the time (we all know that). So it's worth considering -- what makes you happy? And how can you bring that more often into your life?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/1322705134151476135/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/07/happiness.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/1322705134151476135'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/1322705134151476135'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/07/happiness.html' title='Don&apos;t worry, be happy!'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-85239967445553310</id><published>2020-06-29T09:45:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-29T09:45:57.512-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>What I think about when I think about running</title><content type='html'>Today, rather predictably, running was the thing that really centered me. I try to run most days, but that doesn't happen unless I'm coerced into it by some third party. The feeling before a run -- a feeling of lethargy and attachment to a present couch -- is one that all runners know. I think the only difference between fast runners and slow runners is that fast runners can get outside, every time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In engineering or computer science, people often try to find the shortest path between two points. Pure efficiency. In running, however, the goal is really to find the &lt;i&gt;longest &lt;/i&gt;path to your destination. Pure inefficiency. In fact, most times when I run I do go in a circle*, which doesn't get me anywhere at all! These days such an idea seems slightly barbaric. But somehow, the act of running -- no matter how painful and inefficient -- brings me a certain joy. I do love that feeling, pressing my feet into the earth, step after step, and slowly making my way to some place ahead. I usually have no destination in mind, and I try to take every detour and passage-way and unexplored street I can possibly find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes when I run I look around, seeing the branches and trees and children and dogs playing about. It's quite rare on a run that I finish and think "wow, there was absolutely nothing of interest on the 4 miles I jogged." But if I'm honest with myself, I don't pay much attention to my surroundings. I'm usually absorbed in myself, deconstructing something someone said to me, mulling over how I wasn't invited to some exciting event, or occasionally, thinking about what to write in my journal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wherever I went, and whatever was on my mind, when my run is over my mind is clear. The stormy clouds part to reveal a summer's day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;* or rather, a closed path. My multi-variable calculus professor, &lt;a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~zworski/"&gt;Maciej Zworski&lt;/a&gt;, would correct me on that.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/85239967445553310/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/what-i-think-about-when-i-think-about.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/85239967445553310'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/85239967445553310'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/what-i-think-about-when-i-think-about.html' title='What I think about when I think about running'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-151252556024704132</id><published>2020-06-29T09:28:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-29T09:28:11.124-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='review'/><title type='text'>Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut</title><content type='html'>"We know how the universe ends... and Earth has nothing to do with it. We blow it up, experimenting with new fuels for our flying saucers," explains the guide. To most reasonable Tralfamadoreans the response to that is "So it goes."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Time, life, and death to these aliens doesn't follow a straight path, or any path at all. Instead, the Tralfamadoreans see time like we see a mountainous landscape. All at once, always there. No beginnings, no ends, though some people may be experiencing a particular part, or choose to go in a particular direction. The Tralfamadoreans advice to Billy Pilgrim, a war veteran and master of optometry, is simply to ignore the bad times and focus on the good ones. That way you'll always be happy. Trying to change what happens in the future is like me trying to ski away from the bunny slopes. Impossible and very dangerous if attempted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Billy Pilgrim somehow doesn't get this in his head, because he always manages to come unstuck in time. Every crash, smash, or bang brings him back to those moments when he was captured by the Germans. In fact, he still &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;captured by the Germans, in the Tralfamadorean sense. We never see real protest from Billy -- he goes along with his life, no matter where or when it takes him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet the protest comes in other forms. Take one time, an hour before the Tralfamadoreans abducted Billy -- he had some time to kill. He was watching a movie about brave Americans in World War Two bombing fiendish Germans. Except Billy become unstuck in time, and saw it backwards. Instead of a story of war we see a story of peace and reconciliation. American planes suck up fire from a devestated German city and heal it with magical powers. They fly away and back to their country, get disassembled by women working in factories, and their parts shipped to remote areas. "It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again."</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/slaughterhouse-five-by-kurt-vonnegut.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/151252556024704132'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/151252556024704132'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-7501424716394789740</id><published>2020-06-23T12:31:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-25T03:01:57.137-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='capitalism'/><title type='text'>A rant about Salesforce</title><content type='html'>Let's talk about Salesforce. Maybe you don't care about them or what they do --&amp;nbsp; frankly I don't either -- but many people from my school want to go work there. Their internships will give you free housing and lots of money. And according to the stock market they're worth &lt;a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/CRM/market_cap"&gt;171&lt;/a&gt; billion dollars.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First I should say what they do, because the name &lt;i&gt;Salesforce &lt;/i&gt;isn't exactly self-explanatory. Salesforce analyzes a bunch of data. They provide a service, selling special software and algorithms that only they and their Berkeley-educated employees know how to use. Let's look at &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; and see what they say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Turn more contacts into customers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mkay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Collaborate to close deals faster.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Good word, collaborate + the age old adage: &lt;i&gt;always be closing&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Reduce customer response time and build positive, lasting relationships with your clients.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ah. Maybe Salesforce is some kind of therapist, letting you help your clients and help them find out their inner fears. And if customers respond faster, you can connect more often -- kinda like a booty call.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now this is interesting, because even though Salesforce does a very innocuous thing, they've had a lot of criticism. (I'm just looking at their Wikipedia page, so don't take this as high quality investigative journalism).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RAICES donation refusal. The Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services provides legal services to immigrants in the US. They also provide housing for people being tracked down by certain authoritarian governments who don't want foreigners in a country. They do a great thing. But when Salesforce tried to give 250,000$ to them, RAICES refused the donation. Jonathan Ryan, then director of RAICES &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RAICESTEXAS/status/1019975176140701696"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, "the technical services you [Salesforce] provide to CBP form the foundation that helps ICE operate efficiently... your software provides an operational backbone for the agency. There is no room for hair splitting when children are being brutally torn away from parents, when a mother attempts suicide in an effort to get her children released...." Interesting, maybe RAICES is just too picky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assisting in sex trafficking. In 2019 fifty anonymous women &lt;a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/cloud/33343/salesforce-sued-over-dealings-with-sex-trafficking-site"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Salesforce for profiting from and facilitating sex trafficking on Backpage.com, which Salesforce does analytics for. But, I mean, come on -- everyone does a bit of shady business now and then, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2018 Salesforce, along with dozens of other rich companies, paid an effective federal tax rate of &lt;b&gt;0%&lt;/b&gt;. That money's supposed to give schools, food, and clean water to Americans. And instead, it's going to Salesforce executives -- and perhaps a Berkeley students' internship stipend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Maybe these breaches in morality are okay though, a means to an end. Because Salesforce does a good thing, right? They're helping small businesses grow. They're building authentic relationships with customers. They're closing deals and growing the economy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But let's dig a little deeper into Salesforce's language.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Turn more contacts into customers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is targeted advertising. Actually, it's worse than that, because with the troves of data that Salesforce has they find out &lt;i&gt;everything &lt;/i&gt;about their customers -- much like Facebook constructs ghost profiles of non-users. This is not advertising -- it's hypnosis, behavior manipulation via technology.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Collaborate to close deals faster.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Closing deals faster? This is a fetishism of productivity. The companies that make best use of "analytics, reporting, and forecasting" are the big ones, the ones that'll grow even richer with these tools.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Reduce customer response time and build positive, lasting relationships with your clients.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is not a "positive, lasting relationship" -- there is an exploitative, abusive one where Salesforce and their partners turn &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;into a raw material. They want your money. Your attention will be bought and sold -- and so too your votes or purchases -- with Salesforce's help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Agh, okay Rohan. We get the point," you say. "Salesforce is evil, and I'll never work there."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No, no. I don't blame you, or any of my Berkeley friends. We live in a system that encourages us to think these ways and value questionable technology. In fact for some, a job at Salesforce may be the best thing out there (or maybe not! You should explore).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But for god's sake, don't &lt;i&gt;brag &lt;/i&gt;that you got an internship at Salesforce or Snapchat or TikTok or the next cool thing out there. Don't talk about &lt;i&gt;data science &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;artificial intelligence &lt;/i&gt;like it's going to save humankind (It's probably doing the opposite). Don't read those company slogans and think you're at all making a difference, because that's not the point of a corporation. Working under capitalism should be something you don't &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;to do, but you have to -- kind of like voting for Joe Biden or eating your veggies.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/7501424716394789740/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/a-rant-about-salesforce.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7501424716394789740'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/7501424716394789740'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/a-rant-about-salesforce.html' title='A rant about Salesforce'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-51415739221229172</id><published>2020-06-22T07:19:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-22T07:19:26.414-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>post ideas (don't publish)</title><content type='html'>&lt;ul&gt;

There's two reasons, so bear with me. The first is that the London sun seems to never settle. She's like an angry child -- either warm and overly loving or throwing a temper tantrum and not to be seen. So, you wonder, why don't I sit in the shade and avoid this child altogether? The second reason is that I have allergies, and sitting in the shade means sitting in the grass, and that means that the sniffles start up. It's hard to read a book drenched in &lt;a href="https://www.chinesepod.com/dictionary/%E6%B5%81%E9%BC%BB%E6%B6%95"&gt;flowing nasal discharge&lt;/a&gt; (trust me on this). So you see, for this simple task, location matters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The students of Berkeley have recently been faced with a similar challenge. It's because Doctor of Philosophy (etc.) Madam Carol Christ told us that basically school is cancelled. Distance learning, remote classes, Zoom University, it's been called. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;And she went on, saying there's an new offering called Semester in Cloud.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The University of California thinks we're chumps and will take her up on this, since we just can't get enough of this learning business. The worst part is that they're right. Everyone from 1st years to super seniors are essentially taking classes as usual -- except now, we don't have to be in Berkeley.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In some ways this movement is a inevitable part of life. You see, back in the day our ancestors lived in the villages. Then they moved to the cities, maybe to find work and get a good education. Now the cities are out of favor, so some are moving to &lt;strike&gt;the cloud&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Cloud (TM)&lt;/i&gt;. So this whole idea -- the Semester in the Cloud -- raises some 
practical questions. What does the cloud look like? Does it have an 
address? How much does rent cost there?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Christ is smart though -- and due to her name not completely secular -- so I suspect there's something more going on. Something spiritual. You see, just like Avatar Aang 
(the last Airbender, of course) is the portal to the spirit world,
 we can be the portals to &lt;i&gt;the clouuuddd. &lt;/i&gt;Aang closes his eyes, his tattoos flash (are they made from fireflies?), and his spirit and body separate. His spirit is far more exciting, for it wanders around swamps and meets Avatars of the past and creatures older than humanity. Then his physical body just sits there, lotus position.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just like this, I imagine that a Semester in the Cloud is a journey to the spirit world. When we go we shall shuffle off our
 mortal coils and transcend to a world grander than life. We shall explore the worlds of environmental economics, abstract algebra, or epidemiology -- growing and changing and forming a better life for ourselves.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile our physical bodies will pay lots of money to sit comfortably in a chair and stare at a computer screen most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cloud is in our ears and in front of our eyes and frankly in our hearts. We have grown up with the cloud following our every move. Many of us think of it as a third parent. Yet, like some horrid divorce, we are forced to pin the cloud down to a location and make it sign a lease. Some say move to Boulder, Colorado; others pretend that the spirit world can only exist near UC Berkeley. Some may stay in their childhood bedroom, and explore academic life like a rather dull night-time dream. As the Philosopher Tynan said, it's a continuum of options, ranging from loneliness to Coronaness. The world is our oyster.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/8599492494711961053/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/the-cloud-in-our-hearts.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/8599492494711961053'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/8599492494711961053'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/the-cloud-in-our-hearts.html' title='The cloud in our hearts'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-687234186155584394</id><published>2020-06-19T12:31:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-25T03:01:57.120-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='capitalism'/><title type='text'>Big Bad Jeff Post-mortem</title><content type='html'>Exactly four weeks ago I released my animation &lt;i&gt;How to Change the World&lt;/i&gt; about Rosa Parks... and today I finished rendering this baby shark parody, &lt;i&gt;Big Bad Jeff&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZqkSxFrWl2I/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqkSxFrWl2I?feature=player_embedded" width="320"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My gosh, this was time-consuming. I used software called Synfig, which is designed for 2D animations and allows for skeletons, vector graphics, and any number of objects moving around the screen. I thought it was the right tool for the job -- much better than hand-drawing each frame -- but it was really complicated! A large part of these 4 weeks has been, in different ways, learning how this software works properly. Hopefully if I use Synfig in the future, it'll go a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, the actual topic: Jeff Bezos. Amazon's a company so many people know, there's no shortage of media about him, and no shortage of attacks on his company. Amazon provides a great service but, honestly, a company that big shouldn't exist. And a person that rich shouldn't exist either. Personally I enjoyed watching Hasan Minhaj's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5maXvZ5fyQY"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patriot Act &lt;/i&gt;video about this&lt;/a&gt;, and a kick-starter to create this video came from &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/21/is-amazon-unstoppable"&gt;Is Amazon Unstoppable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;in the New Yorker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, this is the first time such commentary has been offered via Baby Shark parody (to my knowledge, at least). &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w"&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/a&gt; is a kids animation / dance video with 5.5 billion views on Youtube. That's a ridiculous amount of views. I first saw it doing morning workouts with kids in China. It's quite an ear-worm (believe me, I've listened to the audio over a hundred times now) -- though honestly I don't know why it's &lt;i&gt;so &lt;/i&gt;popular. The natural thing to do was to combine the Bezos/Amazon critique with a Baby Shark Parody. Anyone could have thought of it! But really, I'm not sure why it occurred to me... and I'm even less sure why I spent four weeks working on this darn video.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In recent weeks Amazon's predatory nature has become really obvious to me. The way they bully companies into marketing on their website, bully factory workers, buy out businesses or put them out of business... It's shark-like. Also, the amount of wealth CEO's like Jeff Bezos are getting during the Coronavirus crisis -- while millions others are starving on the streets -- is staggering. Wealth inequality is staggering. I commend the recent efforts to curb the Amazon monopoly, limit merges and acquisitions, and place a vigorous wealth tax on the rich (spearheaded by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortex and Elizabeth Warren).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tried to be light-hearted and really poke fun at Jeff, rather blatantly attack his company. I think "the left" (whatever that is) can be overly-harsh and negative 
sometimes... Critiques are important, but they're best given with a smile on your 
face. Mr. Bezos on $100 bills, or him hanging out with Mr. Coronavirus is meant to show the ridiculousness of it all. There's tons of anti-Amazon pieces out there, I think my animation falls in a different space. Something that makes you smile, is made for kids, &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;points out injustice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As the philosopher &lt;a href="https://wwwdabblebabble.wordpress.com/2020/06/02/specific/"&gt;euclonho describes it&lt;/a&gt;, multiples of five are "holes in the time line... little pockets of handwavy-ness where you're allowed to steal time from the universe within the bounds of social convention."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;These days, however, I know the power of five minutes. Telling someone "I'll be there in five minutes" means that you'll pretty much be late. It's a dangerous thing, those five minutes, because a whole lot can happen in them, yet the whole time you have to be alert, ready, and waiting for the clock to strike midnight. On the flip side, when we say "three minutes left"&amp;nbsp; -- well, that's a scary thing too. It means that exactly 180 seconds will be ticked on a Grandfather's clock until &lt;a href="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/"&gt;Doomsday&lt;/a&gt; arrives.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;These days, amidst the Great Quaroutine, five minutes is no more time than it takes for Jack Sparrow to find whiskey on a deserted island. Five hours may be closer to the singularity euclonho describes -- or perhaps five days. After all, in our memories five minutes and five days really act the same way. But then, when we sleep how far does five minutes get you? Perhaps just as far as five inches in the Space Race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/8059214107707294878/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/five-minutes-to-go.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/8059214107707294878'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/8059214107707294878'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/five-minutes-to-go.html' title='Five minutes to go'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-1975726997383080602</id><published>2020-06-02T05:48:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-25T03:05:46.443-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social change'/><title type='text'>Whitey's off to space</title><content type='html'>Maybe you've heard this poem before: &lt;i&gt;Whitey On the Moon.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/goh2x_G0ct4/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/goh2x_G0ct4?feature=player_embedded" width="320"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gil Scott-Heron released this in 1970, the year after the US Apollo mission had landed on the moon. The excitement back then must have been palpable. For all of human history, the moon was just a distant orb in the night-sky. Now, it could be explored -- and Americans were doing it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Scott-Heron offers a different take. It's not him on the moon, after all -- it's Whitey. Whitey on the Moon won't help Gil pay rent, won't help his doctor bill, won't help costly food. And what would Gil say today? Well no matter who's off to space, it won't help black folk with bullets in their face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The premise of the space mission is that we're all in it together. The creators of &lt;i&gt;Stark Trek &lt;/i&gt;dreamed of exploring "Space: the final frontier". They dreamed of a prosperous, post-racial world where technology has pushed us -- all of us -- past boundaries we never have dared to break. Elon Musk says that space travel is "about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past." He hopes we can forgo our tumultuous history on earth and soar into the beyond.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But&lt;/i&gt;, I'm not sure that's really possible these days, or that it ever was. For all the talk about post-racial unity, why did &lt;a href="https://history.nasa.gov/sp4801-chapter22.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;NASA tote&lt;/a&gt; anti-black policies until 1971? Why did women's work go &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/" target="_blank"&gt;uncredited&lt;/a&gt; even though it was &lt;i&gt;fundamental &lt;/i&gt;to the Space Race? In 1969, the space mission was government-funded but still science for the elite.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last Saturday, SpaceX launched two astronauts to the International Space Station. &lt;a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/" target="_blank"&gt;According to them&lt;/a&gt;, the "Commercial Crew Program is a turning point for America's future in space exploration that lays the groundwork for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and Beyond."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Was the SpaceX launch cool? I admit yes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But has it unified the country? Does it signify a post-racial American utopia? Hell no. Elon has divided us further -- his launch has set our sights to the beyond when what we need more than anything is to look deeper at home. This is no public enterprise but the fantasy of a sole billionaire, a result of extreme inequality (&lt;i&gt;of course &lt;/i&gt;our fascist President would &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/961073467784421382" target="_blank"&gt;endorse it&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's interesting to compare space exploration to the Age of 
Exploration. This time is remembered fondly in our textbooks. New 
countries being "discovered", trade routes and cross-culturalism abound. But this viewpoint conveniently ignores the genocide 
of Native Americans, the cruel and hegemonic British Empire, and the 
mass spreading of disease.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, developing countries &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-disaster-developing-nations-global-marshall-plan" target="_blank"&gt;fighting Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, people are raising their voices against police brutality, and, well -- Whitey's off to space.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/1975726997383080602/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/maybe-youve-heard-this-poem-before.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/1975726997383080602'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/1975726997383080602'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/maybe-youve-heard-this-poem-before.html' title='Whitey&apos;s off to space'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/goh2x_G0ct4/0.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-5987925990630275856</id><published>2020-06-01T02:53:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-25T03:05:16.392-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='review'/><title type='text'>Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro</title><content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go &lt;/i&gt;is a sad story. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are some stories that grip you from start to finish. Page-turners or thrillers they might be called. And then there are stories that take you to another world, a place so magical that you can escape from the mundane-ness of real life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go &lt;/i&gt;did none of those things, yet it caught me in a trance. The setting of the story (this review will contain spoilers) is a place called Hailsham, a boarding school for children. Part 1 deals with the main characters -- Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy -- as they grow up in the school. In Part 2, the characters move to the Cottages where they meet students from other schools and are in anticipation of training for their future occupations. They must grapple with the brutal reality that they are clones, born only so that their organs may be harvested. They hope with all hopes that there may be a way out. And in Part 3, Kathy becomes a carer for Ruth and Tommy. They reflect on their experiences, soaking in their last moments together before they are "completed", and Tommy and Kathy eventually try to fight against the dismal path that has been set for them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This novel is not driven by plot. This is no &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt;, where knowing that Snape killed Dumbledore can ruin the book for a young reader (or &lt;i&gt;Mice and Men&lt;/i&gt;, god forbid a spoiler for that). &lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go &lt;/i&gt;is written in a matter-of-fact yet carefully considered way. In the early chapters there is no sense that Kathy even lives in a dystopian world. We are immersed in her childlike innocence. There are some strange aspects, like why the kids have to trade in art for tokens, or where the parents of these children are... but more pressing are the day-to-day things. Why is everyone so mean to Tommy? Why is Ruth such a poser?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At first, I felt unfamiliar with this type of novel. In real-life, movies, and books, I'm usually perplexed why people get upset (as J.K. Rowling might say, I have the 'emotional range of a teaspoon'). I reflect now that we really do live in the realm of symbols. What 
does it mean when someone ignores you in a conversation? When someone 
gangs up on you with your best friend? When someone keeps your unspoken secret? These actions really do matter, not
 just in the sense of their material result. So too does tone, and the 
way we can be kind and gentle, or harsh or abrasive, with others in
 our life. The moving parts of &lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go &lt;/i&gt;lie on this symbolic plane. The amount we care for the characters begins to define the novel, and what seemed plot-less becomes thick with drama and heartache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The biggest injustice in the book -- an injustice that overshadows all others -- is the purpose of Hailsham students' very existence. From the beginning, Ishiguro brings us so close to these students follies and fortunes. But it's revealed to us, and to the students as they grow older, that these adventures mean nothing in the end. In this England, clones have no right to a free and happy life. In fact, the students &lt;i&gt;are privileged&lt;/i&gt; to go to make, have friends and loved ones because most people like them have none of this (what conditions are other clones raised in? We can only imagine.) We find that no matter how lovely a childhood Kathy had -- no matter how tightly she gripped the doll and said &lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go &lt;/i&gt;-- this world was not made for her. No matter how deep and her strong her love goes, her life is ripped apart when she comes of age. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is this so different from real life? Call me cynical, but I don't think so. Though life can seem rosy for many, I know that for most of the privileges in society someone else has to be pushed aside. Perhaps it's the custodial staff who come in late in the evenings to clean university libraries. Perhaps it's the Nike sweatshop workers across the world who, day-to-day, risk their lives in dangerous conditions to make Western apparel. Perhaps it's the farmed animals -- numbering in the billions -- who die each year so their bodies can be sold to our stomachs. Who makes these choices? Who decides who's rich and who's poor? Who decides whose life matters? These questions are lurking in the background of &lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go&lt;/i&gt;, never explicitly mentioned but impossible to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In real life and in Ishiguro's England, the glaring injustice of society is never discussed. Hailsham is not really a school, but an example of a "humane" way to "rear" clones -- to give them a good life before they "complete". The childrens' true fate is only hinted at throughout their upbringing, for knowing the truth would break the illusion of happiness*. The art that Kathy and her friends create in class as children is taken to show "who they really are" -- that is, to prove to others that clones have deep personal lives. To Miss Emily, Madam, and others, Hailsham is a big step for the movement. To Kathy and Tommy and the reader, this perspective seems a little outrageous. Who else knows how &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;the clones' lives except those who have lived them first-hand? The thought of having to prove ones' individuality and &lt;i&gt;life&lt;/i&gt; is an assault to that life itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt sad after reading &lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go. &lt;/i&gt;In some ways I feel that the world of Tommy and Ruth and Kathy is still around, whether in the exact form of Hailsham or in another way. That makes the ending quite real, even if it is a dystopia. But though this book was sad, reading it shielded me from the stressful cycle of news. It was an escape from relentless statistics into person-to-person empathy that seems missing in the way we understand the world. And that really was cathartic -- like the tears of clouds which make the world a little greener. Sometimes a dose of sadness is really what we need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;* There are many illusions in this novel. The make-believe skits and plots between the children at Hailsham are examples, but there are far more sinister ones surrounding their lives. The children hold onto hopes that once someone leaves Hailsham, they can grow up to be anyone they want -- they hold onto this because the truth would simply be too upsetting. And England at large holds onto the idea that raising children so that they can &lt;i&gt;die &lt;/i&gt;for anothers' benefit is at all morally right. &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/feeds/5987925990630275856/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/never-let-me-go-by-kazuo-ishiguro.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5987925990630275856'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/597296393545314941/posts/default/5987925990630275856'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.rohanprasad.org/2020/06/never-let-me-go-by-kazuo-ishiguro.html' title='Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro'/><author><name>rohantohab</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/16147050129636422772</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-597296393545314941.post-830873810584616252</id><published>2020-05-25T02:57:00.005-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-25T03:03:40.214-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='personal'/><title type='text'>Pad thai</title><content type='html'>Pad thai seems to be the only thing that can bring my family together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, almost. Me, my brother, and my dad got it from Banana Tree, a Thai place. But my mom got the pad thai from an Indian place right next-door. Geographically close, yet symbolically different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So we all eat pad thai. Together, in the same room, but also apart. Some of our legs are crossed, some are put down. Some of us sit at the kitchen table, some on the couch. Most of us are on our phones (of course). Certainly not together holding hands and saying grace and making polite conversation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why? American food isn't good, flavorful, or spicy enough for my parents. East Asian isn't either -- they just can't get behind the whole tofu thing. And my brother having Indian food? That's out of the question. They are simply &lt;a href="https://wwwdabblebabble.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/dont-point-the-finger/" target="_blank"&gt;incompatible&lt;/a&gt; with each other. So a lot of the time when we eat "together", it's pad thai.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then there's the whole vegan thing. Vegan cheese? Un-American. Eating anything but chicken('s) wings with your hands? Un-American. Dosa with coconut chutney? Delicious, but un-American.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My brother is American through and through. That's why he's going there today. Vroom. Off he goes, on a plane to the Nation's capital and away from here. He is set on this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Me? I have a mixed relationship with America. I live there (normally, at least, when there's no virus). I study there, if I study at all. And I was born there (no parenthesis there). I can probably name more things wrong with America than things that are right. Maybe that's un-American. In another sense, it could be like tough love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And my parents, too, have this mixed relationship. They lived there for a while, and called it home before moving to the UK. They have American accents, for the most part. But my family isn't American like the ones that have a home there, go there for summer holidays, or visit grandparents for Thanksgiving or Christmas. No, those times are reminders that we're not fully American. That part of our lives is still in India, whether we like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;

    Several days ago, I hiked the Berkeley Fire Trails with two close
 friends as an end to our semester. We walked for an hour up the trail… 
through the dark paths, avoiding knotted roots and murky puddles. As we 
approached the top, the narrow path we had hiked opened to a wide, 
grassy clearing. San Francisco was in full view, with its tall towers 
and bright lights, cars relentlessly zooming by. Even on our midnight 
hike, a respite from the busy semester, it seemed impossible to escape 
from the rage of urban life. We looked out onto the City – the hub of 
the Silicon Valley – and it felt at that earnest moment that real life 
had been trumped by a virtual world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


From our vantage point, I thought about Mark Zuckerberg’s words: &lt;em&gt;It was built to accomplish a social mission – to make the world more open and connected&lt;/em&gt;.
 I suppose this is the guiding principles of Facebook (if they employ 
any principles at all). Our world looks connected, yes. We are connected
 in an economic sense, buying things from across the country that can 
reach our doorstep the next day, wearing shirts made from a factory in 
Cambodia, and handling a device that was assembled in China. In a social
 sense, we have hundreds of “friends” on Facebook, we can text others 
every moment of every day, and news is given to us every minute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


Such connection – particularly the social aspect – seems ripe for 
prosperity and social change. Buying our goods from far-away, it is 
said, graces us with affordable purchases while giving employment to 
those less privileged. Social media seems like the breeding grounds for 
activism. By having so many digital connections, we can form online 
communities of a size and strength previously not possible. We can 
support other groups by “liking” the pages and thus easily form 
coallitions. On online forums, we can engage in direct action and 
challenge others in a public way (while remaining safe behind our 
keyboard). It seems the key parts of a social movement – community, 
coallitions, and direct action – are easily attained online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


I don’t think I challenge these ideas in an abstract sense. Online 
communities have been a large part of my life, especially the earlier 
days of Youtube (with creators like VlogBrothers or Numberphile) and 
different forums on Reddit (like /r/likeus, /r/oddlysatisfying, or the 
interesting and hilarious /r/outside) (and I myself am writing on a 
blog-post!) Of course, there are other projects of brilliant scale: the 
development of GNU Linux and the creation of Wikipedia, for instance, 
have both democratized computing power and information in an incredible 
way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


But social networks are a different beast. Facebook may have started 
as a garage-based experiment with software, but suddenly it has 
entrenched itself into our society. It has grown to the scale of 
billions of people – beyond what any one person can imagine, and 
certainly beyond what it was originally conceived to be. But this 
expansion has not happened with the best of intentions. In our age, 
Facebook’s primary purpose is not to host informed discussions or let 
you talk to your grandma – it’s to turn a profit. This type of software 
is proprietary, not open-source; it has hundreds of developers, 
psychologists, and business-people working to seize your mind to make 
money.&lt;br /&gt;


Even if we think we are using Facebook as a tool for another cause, it undeniably attacks &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;
 in a array of dimensions. Notifications on Facebook are designed to 
distract our focus, working beyond the point of helpfulness and causing 
wide-spread cases of addiction and depression. Facial recognition 
software turns our harmless posts of photos into a dataset for 
recognition, expanding the reach of the American surveillance state. We 
all heard about the catastrophe in 2018, when Cambridge Analytica used 
our profile information to predict our political views, potentially 
helping wreck havoc on liberal democracy. In short, Facebook treats us 
like Big Ag considers animals – not as people, but as objects to be used
 and exploited.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


These tendencies should be disturbing for anyone – particularly an 
activist. I would argue that because of these incentives, any 
capabilities Facebook (or other social networks controlled by malicious 
corporations) has to aid activism is not to be trusted. Anything that 
resembles legitimate discussion will soon be over-run by trolls and 
demagogues. Any messages sent on such a platform can be intercepted by 
the government when it’s most crucial. If any information is sent 
online, we should not fight for “engagements” or attention on a platform
 that is designed to exploit us. The Revolution simply won’t happen 
online.&lt;br /&gt;


Cliff Stoll, a retired astrophysics professor and online educator, 
wrote an essay in 1995 on this topic. He was a lonely voice of dissent 
in a world of techno-optimists. I was struck by this paragraph:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


“What’s missing from this electronic wonderland? Human contact. 
Discount the fawning techno-burble about virtual communities. Computers 
and networks isolate us from one another. A network chat line is a limp 
substitute for meeting friends over coffee. No interactive multimedia 
display comes close to the excitement of a live concert. And who’d 
prefer cybersex to the real thing? While the Internet beckons brightly, 
seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace lures 
us to surrender our time on earth. A poor substitute it is, this virtual
 reality where frustration is legion and where—in the holy names of 
Education and Progress—important aspects of human interactions are 
relentlessly devalued.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


I believe in so many ways, we have seen Professor Stoll’s predictions come true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


It’s worth it to consider how activism has happened in the past. It 
was done when people went door-to-door and canvassed against destructive
 companies. It was done through in-person meetings, hashing out campaign
 strategy on a blackboard. It was and is done through confrontation: 
looking others in the eye and showing that &lt;em&gt;you care&lt;/em&gt;. Martin Luther King Jr. didn’t write his &lt;em&gt;Letter from Birmingham Jail&lt;/em&gt; in a tweet – he wrote it in a prison cell, in solitude. &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; the focus we need to change the world. Yes, we must adapt to the times, but we cannot forget that what matters most of all is &lt;strong&gt;human connection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    When I was little, I used to love playing with numbers. I’d try 
the New York Times Sudoku puzzles with my mom. I would hone my skills in
 arithmetic in games online and then zoom through the “minute 
multiplication” in school, loving the competition of it. I even learned a
 trick to calculate the day of the week of any date, past, present, or 
future, inspired by a TED talk I watched. Every bit of math and 
numerical manipulation enthralled me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


There is something intoxicating about studying mathematics. It 
follows the rhyme and reason not of Shakespeare, but of propositional 
logic; the only thing you need to do to “prove” something is write a few
 statements that indicate it is so. Those nasty word problems involving 
lots of algebra seem impossible at first, but after a moment of 
realization it’s clear that all that’s needed to solve them is to write 
an equation in a special way. The harder the problem, the more 
complicated the equation – this is a trend that follows some for years 
beyond high school.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


In a certain way it seems ridiculous. But I have always believed in 
numbers. I have always trusted data, so long as there’s a lot of it. And
 this is a conviction that is widespread in many fields – that the best 
way to solve climate change is to “engineer” a solution, that the best 
way to solve inequality is a more progressive wealth tax, that the best 
way to stop disease is to model it with differential equations. Such a 
belief, again, is intoxicating. It turns the big, bad, messy world into 
an easy model. The unspoken assumption in economics, science, 
engineering, is that there’s a solution if you simply level up the 
mathematics – that with sufficiently detailed equations, you can 
describe our society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


It was shocking to me to realize that this is not how the world 
works. I realized that despite the hundreds of millions of people 
trapped in poverty – a number so big it should shock any numerate person
 – no one really cares. I realized that despite the certainty that the 
world is &lt;em&gt;dying&lt;/em&gt; – through hundreds of scientifically proven 
statements – the political forces are simply not there. And I realized 
that despite the &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of non-human beings we murder, ruthlessly, every year… No one wants to talk about animal rights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


Why is this? Why are we as human beings so unwilling to accept facts 
right in front of us? Why do we cling to what is known instead of what 
the data says?&lt;br /&gt;


I feel what is lacking in raw numbers is a &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;. Truly, a 
story. Stories last for thousands of years – myths and legends from 
ancient India, China, Greece… anywhere have been passed down through 
generations. I remember when I was little, too, I would beg my mom to 
continue reading Enid Blyton’s &lt;em&gt;The Five Find-outers&lt;/em&gt; as she sat by my bedside. I would be entranced by the mythological world of Percy Jackson, and by the magic of &lt;em&gt;Eragon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of Ga’Hoole&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


These stories, statistics, have &lt;em&gt;no basis&lt;/em&gt; in reality. They 
probably don’t even follow the laws of physics. And yet I was, am, and 
will always be transfixed by stories. And I think others are too. Barack
 Obama’s speech in 2004, simply telling the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; of his family coming to America, is known as the one that made him president. Upton Sinclair’s &lt;em&gt;The Jungle&lt;/em&gt;
 shed light on the horrific meat-packing industry in a way that labor 
statistics never could, thus bringing about massive legislative changes 
in the meat-packing industry. And of course, the story of Rosa Parks in 
the Civil Rights Movement – not the countless facts about discrimination
 in America – is what sparked a wave of resistance across the South.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


There’s no science to story-telling. However much I may long for it, 
no equation can predict which stories will cut to the hearts of people. 
No computer (not yet) can write a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; story – one with characters you fall in love with, one that shakes you at the core.
Thus the story-teller gains an extraordinary power. When I find time to read a novel (recently, Khaled Hosseini’s &lt;em&gt;A Thousand Splendid Suns&lt;/em&gt;) I remember the magic it takes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


I’ve always been told numbers – big data, statistics, economics – are
 the way to land a job and change the world. I think now that to really 
make people &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;, it’s really important to nourish the art of story-telling. There’s really nothing like it.&lt;br /&gt;


  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;On November 22nd, 2019 the Berkeley College Republicans 
hosted Ann Coulter, a conservative commentator, on the UC campus. 
Several hundred students and anti-fascist protesters demonstrated before
 and during the speech. Police was called to prevent violence, and 
eventually 5 were arrested in the rally.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Ann Coulter is a fascist” were the signs posted on Dwinelle Hall. 
Such a statement is widely agreed upon by most liberals – statements 
like “why do we let people in wheelchairs become citizens? I feel sorry 
for cripples, but that doesn’t mean I want them in my country.”, or “I 
have to say I’m all for public flogging.”, or “God gave us the earth. We
 have dominion over the plants, the animals, the trees.” Such blatantly 
discriminatory statements, statements marginalizing people in 
already-difficult circumstances… Statements that define who is superior,
 who is inferior, and who is allowed to be a citizen. Such statements 
are akin to those made in Nazi Germany – this is fascism in the extreme.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, the argument goes, Ann Coulter should not be allowed on our campus. Now, this is where things get a little tricky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the one hand, she technically &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; have the right, at 
least in the US, to speak. No matter how vilely racist, one might say 
that she is protected by the “right” to Free Speech. This is, however, 
with a caveat: that her speech does not cause or incite violence against
 anyone else. You have the right to say, “I disagree with Trump,” but 
not to say anything encouraging physical harm against him. And despite 
the horridness of her statements, Ann Coulter doesn’t directly incite 
violence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, one might extend this concept of &lt;i&gt;physical&lt;/i&gt; violence to &lt;i&gt;emotional&lt;/i&gt;
 violence. UC Berkeley, some claim, should be a sanctuary for 
marginalized groups – a place for people to feel safe and unthreatened. 
Ann Coulter’s words – even if they are just words – threaten minorities 
at this university, hearkening back to threats against Jews in the 
Holocausts. It is horrifyingly scary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what’s my issue? Why am I writing this post? My problem isn’t one 
about vision; I believe in the same world that the anti-fascist protests
 were fighting for last night. I have an issue of approach – that &lt;i&gt;shutting down&lt;/i&gt; speakers with such forcefulness is simply not in line with the world of peace and tranquility that we are striving for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that this is related to “Cancel Culture”. Cancel Culture is
 something we’ve all heard of – the idea that in order to educate people
 about social inequalities, we should simply call them out. In order to 
stop racism, it is said, we have to ridicule someone every time they 
call Africa a country. In order to stop speciesism, we need to vilify 
anyone eating an animal. And in order to stop fascism, we have to call 
fascists out when they speak and &lt;b&gt;shut them down&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Such a culture is reflected in the very framing of many movements: “&lt;i&gt;Anti&lt;/i&gt;fascists”, rather than “liberationists”; the “United Week &lt;i&gt;Against&lt;/i&gt;
 Hate” (from Carol Christ’s campus-wide email), not the “United Week for
 Love”; that “Ann Coulter is not welcomed here” (from the Black Student 
Union’s statement).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The mere framing of these issues turn them into a controversial one. 
Leftist groups – groups pushing for a compassionate, just and inclusive 
society – have fallen into the trap of using shocking, negative language
 to communicate a message. This makes admirable activists be subject to 
critique, because to the uninformed observer, “Ann Coulter is not 
welcomed here” also seems like a type of fascism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And it’s quite clear that &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; framings are an essential
 part of social movements. In the 1960s, oppressed black people fought 
for Civil Rights as well as anti-segregation laws. In the 1990s, queer 
people fought for Marriage Equality and against a culture of homophobia.
 But it is the compassionate messaging that sticks with us – it is 
abundantly clear from their message that the Civil and Gay Rights 
Movements were fighting for a just world, a prospect far more agreeable.
 This is simply what I wish the Berkeley protesters would take into 
consideration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And with this compassionate language comes compassionate dialog 
between people of different backgrounds. We should engage in 
evidence-based dialog, not shut down opposition after one bigoted 
statement. We should do creative, positive demonstrations in line with 
the just world that we imagine. We should channel the energies used 
against fascists and use it &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; a more beautiful world. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt;, to me, is what social justice is about.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;This is a letter I wrote to my economics professor about what
 we are taught in university. The main idea, I suppose, is that we 
should not only ask “what is efficient?” but also, “what is right?”&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dear Professor _____&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hope you are well! I wanted to address my comment in Monday’s class
 – “why study the Welfare theorems if they are based on such ‘stupid’ 
premises?” – because I fear it was taken the wrong way. But first, I am 
sorry for my sass and any disturbance it caused, and I appreciated your 
thoughtful answer despite that. I meant to explain further, and so I 
hope to visit your office hours next week. Regardless, I wrote down some
 of my thoughts so we could be on the same page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I agree that the Welfare Theorems and other important results in 
classical economics are beautiful and profound. Some of the results of 
respected economists are indeed miraculous, and it is an honor to study 
such subjects from esteemed professors such as yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It seems to us students, however, that these beautiful theorems are 
seem unrelated to our actual world. You made the point that in physics, 
we first study the frictionless, idealized case before moving onto 
complications. This is all very well for physicists. But economics is 
about people, not particles, and living beings cannot simply be reduced 
to mathematical equations. Moreover, making these erroneous assumptions 
while ignoring the suffering caused can have massive consequences in our
 world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An example is in the recent problem set, where Question 3 was about 
“perfect competition”, set in a “mango farm” in the Philippines. If one 
researches a little into the plight of Filipinx farmers and 
international corporations, this sentence suddenly seems massively 
inappropriate. It’s well-known that farmers there face dangerous 
chemicals, long hours, and exploitative conditions, all of which was 
ignored in your problem set.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One example is an article by a Filipino journalist about the plight 
of rice farmers in his country. He writes, “there was a time when 
[farming and agriculture] boosted the economy and put us on the map… 
today, our rice farming industry is up against the ropes and our own 
government… how can we pay people less and still expect them to 
survive?” Nevertheless, the very theorems that you tote in class are the
 ones that companies use to justify exploitation of workers around the 
globe.
https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2019/09/17/1952474/plight-filipino-rice-farmers&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The continued obsession with “rational consumers”, the “free” market,
 and other neo-liberal assumptions has had horrible consequences on 
nations in the past. An example of this is the actions of the World Bank
 in Jamaica, where the imposition of the Structural Adjustment Loan 
Project caused an unnecessary reduction in public safety nets and social
 support, massively harming poor people in a formerly-colonized nation. 
Fatmir Haskaj referenced an exhaustive article about this in his 
Berkeley class on global poverty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, an obsession with the “free” market is an insult to the 
planet and non-human life on our earth. The same economists who 
theorized about Pareto efficiency have been the creators of industrial 
capitalism, the force that is destroying our planet. British journalist 
George Monbiot has an excellent piece on the evils of this exploitative 
system:
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/capitalism-economic-system-survival-earth&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But even despite all this, I really love economics. I love playing 
with equations, optimizing variables, and thinking about our world 
through this lens. I also find it equally important to consider the 
social ramifications of what economists are saying. We should not just 
ask “what is efficient”, but also “what is right? “&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Economics could have
 so much to say about the environment, human and animal rights, and 
other social justice issues of our time. It is my hope that your class 
can cover those topics – not as a side-tangent, but as a serious issue –
 so that students can emerge the class with tools to make the world a 
better place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most sincerely, &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;This essay contains spoilers for Shrek (2001). If you haven’t seen it, you have a deep problem that needs addressing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though only eighteen years old, &lt;i&gt;Shrek&lt;/i&gt; is one of those films 
that deserves to be in the Western Canon. Its story is the classic tale 
of the white knight saving a princess from a castle, but with a twist – 
Shrek, the hero, is an “ugly” green ogre, ordered by Lord Farquaad to 
rescue Princess Fiona to get back his swamp. &lt;i&gt;Shrek&lt;/i&gt; has been 
revered as a children’s classic, made with stellar animation and subtle 
adult humor, but I believe that it is much more than just a kid’s movie.
 In fact, &lt;i&gt;Shrek&lt;/i&gt; is a movie about animal rights, deeply probing the notion of human supremacy, and suggesting animality that is within us all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story starts with the troubling persecution of “the ogre” near 
Shrek’s home. A group of villagers, all white males, gather pitchforks 
and torches and head into the forest. Their task: to kill Shrek, the 
“menace” they have not yet met. Such persecution, done by common people,
 is undeniably fascist – it is akin to red-tagging in the Philippines 
throughout the era of Martial Law, the persecution of Jewish people 
leading up to the Holocaust, or religious violence against Muslims in 
India. Farquaad, the ruler of the land, set the orders, but he appealed 
to a intrinsic fear of the human populations – fear of “the other” too 
close to home. Shrek is one of many victims of persecution, as evidenced
 by the creatures from all over the kingdom that seek refuge in his 
swamp. Shrek, however, does not allow the others into his territory, 
showing the selfishness that comes when people are put under distress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The origin of these attacks is Lord Farquaad, the dictator and symbol
 of human supremacy. We first see Farquaad torturing the Gingerbread 
Man, pulling off bodyparts and dunking the Gingerbread Man into milk. 
Later, we see Farquaad questioning the Mirror on the Wall, threatening 
violence (smashing of the mirror) and forcing answers out of the 
spiritual being. The power Farquaad exerts over other beings is clear – 
he holds the threat of violence, he isolates his victims so they have no
 social support, and he has political power over the entire kingdom. 
Even the Guards, empty suits of army, are under the command of Farquaad 
even if he does not do them harm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Such human supremacy can be directly compared to real-life violations
 of animal rights. The torturing of the Gingerbread Man is akin to 
vivisection of animals (often done when they are alive), chemical 
testing, or psychological experimentation. These exertions of human 
supremacy are done under the pretense of utilitarian benefit (for 
medicine or cosmetics), but &lt;i&gt;in every case&lt;/i&gt; do &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; 
for the species harmed. The exploitation of the Mirror can be compared 
to the dairy industry, which seperates mothers from their children with 
the goal of extracting bodily fluids, unconsentually and under the 
threat of violence (cows that do not participate in milking are hit for 
being “lazy”). Most stark, however, is the psychology of the Human 
Supremacist, who believes that he (for it is always a &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt;) can exploit others to no end with no consequence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if this film is against Human Supremacy, what do we make of the 
exotification of Fiona, the human female? Fiona holds herself to human 
female standards in many ways: her voice is clear and refined in 
contrast to Shrek’s raw Scottish accent; she takes great pride in her 
human appearance and is shocked when she sees Shrek is an Ogre; and she 
mostly is able to do domestic labour. Nevertheless, it’s clear that 
Fiona has repressed animality in her actions. At several points, we see 
Fiona enjoy getting dirty in the mud of the forest, burp in front of 
Donkey and Shrek, and rapidly take down Guards with martial arts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To us, these actions are unexpected because they are both masculine 
and animalistic. Yet it demonstrates the repression that effects us when
 we subscribe to patriarchal or anthropocentric frameworks – in fact, 
the yearning to belch, take down enemies, or roll around in dirt is 
within us all. To pretend to is to reject our unity with nature, and to 
pretend that we as humans are not still bound by inner instincts. Of 
course, a literal manifestation of this is Fiona’s nightly 
transformations, a statement that no matter how refined, no human can 
escape the “curse” of animality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Farquaad is deposeda (and killed) at the end of the film, a 
supposedly happy ending, but we should still question the validity of 
the new reign. In democracies and dictatorships alike, foul rulers are 
only toppled when their pillars of support are shifted, whether it be 
the military that backs them or a dramatic change in public opinion. In 
the case of Shrek, non-human creatures still have no political rights, 
and no voice in this feudal society. They are protected by the 
technocratic rulers, Shrek and Fiona, but that is no guarantee of 
long-term safety. Shrek and Fiona have their own biases, internal hatred
 of non-humans, and violent tendancies, and perhaps for a truly just 
society a new, democratic regime is needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite these short-comings*, &lt;i&gt;Shrek&lt;/i&gt; the movie stands as a 
powerful statement for animal rights. It is a story about the tyranny of
 humans, the beauty of inter-species cooperation, and a movement towards
 a just world for all. Its message is one that I hope we can carry into 
the world at large.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* One small foot-note: the jokes making fun of Donkey (“Shrek’s ass”)
 are speciesist. They recreate the narrative that Donkeys are 
unintelligent, vile, and unrespectable. Though used comically, the same 
depiction of donkeys is used to justify their enslavement and 
commidification for human use. Such jokes are also examples of human 
supremacy.&lt;/div&gt;

    This week I am planning to employ a version of “digital 
minimalism”. The goal of it is to redefine my relationship to 
technology, and to only use it in a way that serves my values.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


This idea comes from a computer science professor, Cal Newport, and a
 book he wrote called Digital Minimalism. He claims the way to do this 
is to cut out &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; digital devices from one’s life for a month 
(or so). After one experiences an entirely analog life, the Minimalist 
very gradually adds technology that clearly services their goals. For 
instance, if someone believed that Facebook bolstens their social life, 
they might realize after taking a break that they are perfectly happy 
contacting close friends through other means. Thus, they would not add 
Facebook back into their life. Without taking that first leap, however, 
the person wouldn’t realize that technology actually does a &lt;em&gt;disservice&lt;/em&gt; to their life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


We often believe that every single bit of technology we allow into 
our lives makes us happier. Many of my peers use AirPods, the Apple 
Watch, and other pervassive devices to be in &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt; 
connection with the world wide web. More time online, it is said, lets 
us read more, listen to more podcasts, connect with friends about last 
minute changes in plans. There is no perceived downside to the 
Maximalist’s way of life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


In fact, this can be very destructive. I myself have noticed my 
attention span greatly reduced when I always have the choice to be 
online. I notice my ability to deepy introspect suffer when there is so 
much information available online. I notice that as my online presence 
grows, my presence in the real-world diminishes. A quote I once heard 
summmed this up well: “A wealth of information means a poverty of 
attention.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


And so, I find it extremely important to take control of our minds. Our capacity to focus and be present is refined &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;
 when we are in completely in the real-world. A digital reality is not a
 reality at all, and any connections to the internet are potential 
sources of destruction for our lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


And yet I am hypocritical. I can’t really bring myself to eliminate &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;
 technology from my life, but this coming week is a dip in the water of 
life. My version of Digital Minimalism, from October 28th (Monday) to 
November 3rd (Sunday), is to:&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not use my smart-phone for a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only connect to internet on my laptop for 30 minutes each morning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only use email, BCourses, and a couple other essential websites during online time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
For people to contact me, I will respond to email once a day, and 
have a “brick” phone to mainly make and recieve calls (texting is hard 
on those things!).&lt;br /&gt;
